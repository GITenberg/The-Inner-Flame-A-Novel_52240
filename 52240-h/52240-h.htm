<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">A NOVEMBER NIGHT</p>


<p>Soft snowflakes whirled around the lonely
mountain cabin under a November sky. The
wind that had rushed up the valley sighing and
groaning between the wooded walls, now
roared its wild delight in the freedom of the
heights. The twilight was deepening fast. Two
women were alone in the cabin. The one who
was at home stooped and put another log on the
blazing fire. The other could not have stooped,
no matter how willing her spirit, so straitly and
fashionably was her ample figure bound by artful
bone and steel.</p>

<p>"Mercy, Mary!" she ejaculated, standing
stock still in the middle of the room, fixed there
by a triumphant shriek of the rioting wind. "I
never had the least desire to go up in an aeroplane.
Are you well anchored here?"</p>

<p>"Like a lichen on a rock," returned Mary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Sidney, smiling. "Take off your hat, Isabel,
and be comfy."</p>

<p>"Do you think we <em>must</em> stay all night?" demurred
the visitor. "You know I love you,
Mary, and if that wind would just let us hear
ourselves think, I wouldn't ask anything better
than an evening's chat with you alone."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't as it is," returned Mrs. Sidney
soothingly, approaching her cousin and
unpinning the veil which Mrs. Fabian had not
raised. The visitor clung to her wraps with the
feeling that an entire readiness to flee back to
the haunts of men would aid her to depart.
Mary Sidney's calm amused smile carried some
reassurance. It flickered across her face as the
firelight flickered across the dark rafters above.</p>

<p>"I <em>told</em> Henry I thought the sky looked
threatening before we left town," declared the
guest while she submitted to the gentle touch,
"but nothing would do but that he should visit
the mine this very afternoon. Isn't this fearful,
Mary?" as a renewed gust shook the firelit
rafters until they creaked heavily.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, this sounds a great deal worse than
it is," was the response.</p>

<p>"You're comforting me, I know you are";
and Mrs. Fabian, denuded of her correct hat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
permitted herself to take the offered chair by
the fire. "I hope, though, that you have a kennel
of St. Bernard dogs in the back yard. I <em>should</em>
like to see Henry again, bad as he is!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Sidney took the other chair and rolled
a blazing log to a better position.</p>

<p>"You'll see the men coming along in a little
while&mdash;when they grow hungry," she returned
placidly.</p>

<p>"And how in the world do you get servants
up here?" demanded the other.</p>

<p>"We don't. We could get a Chinaman, but if
we had him we'd have to amuse him, there's no
one else for him to talk to, so we go without."</p>

<p>"Horrors!" ejaculated Mrs. Fabian with solemn
repugnance. "And you live here alone!"</p>

<p>The hostess laughed at her tone. "Not
enough of the year to dislike it. One learns a lot
of things in these hills&mdash;bidding farewell to
time, for instance. You see a man with a gun
tramping through the valley and you rush to
the door, and cry out, 'Hey, there, you with
the gun, what day is this?' and the man
turns and shouts back, 'You can't prove it by
me!'"</p>

<p>Mrs. Sidney laughed again and her cousin
shuddered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank God for civilization!" ejaculated
the latter devoutly; then, as the window-glass
sucked in and out with a cracking sound, "Give
me my hat, Mary," she said, sitting up. "If
we're going down the mountain-side, let's go
decently and in order."</p>

<p>"For shame, you Maine woman!" was the
laughing rejoinder. "Your sea-captains would
call this 'a breeze o' wind!' That's all. That's
another thing one becomes acquainted with up
here: the wind. I didn't know anything about it
when I came. You should be here some nights
if you call this a storm! I used to set my dish-pans
out at the door; but when a few had
whirled down the mountain-side into the valley,
I learned caution. One can't go around the
corner here and buy a dish-pan."</p>

<p>"Mary," Mrs. Fabian eyed her with bewildered
admiration, "you're wonderful! You
didn't used to be wonderful," she added in an
argumentative tone. "Once you'd have made
just as much fuss about this as I would. You
remember&mdash;if you try, you'll remember perfectly&mdash;that
I warned you, more than twenty-five
years ago, not to marry a mining engineer.
I told you then it was just as bad as marrying
an army officer. There would be no repose about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
it, and no comfort. You see I was right. Here
we are, to all intents and purposes, in a shrieking
balloon, and you call it home!" The speaker
kept a watchful eye on the rattling casement
and drew herself up with renewed tension at
each wind blast, but nevertheless she talked
on.</p>

<p>"With it all you haven't as many lines in
your face as I have, and your hair is as brown as
ever. Mine would be white if I lived here instead
of in New York. And the calmness of
your eyes, and your smile! Tell me, Mary, tell
me now honestly,&mdash;I shall sympathize with you,&mdash;<em>is</em>
it the calmness of despair?"</p>

<p>Mary Sidney did not smile. She looked into
the depths of the fire and her guest wondered
what memories were unfolding themselves to
her rapt vision.</p>

<p>"No," she answered simply at last, "such
calmness as I possess is not of despair, but of&mdash;faith."
The speaker paused before the utterance
of the last word as if hesitating for the one
which should best express her meaning.</p>

<p>"Do you mean something religious?" asked
Mrs. Fabian stiffly.</p>

<p>The stiffness was not disapproval. It was
owing to the divided attention she was bestow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>ing
upon the storm, lest if she took her mind off
the wind it might seize the advantage and hurl
the cabin from its moorings.</p>

<p>"I should think a person would <em>have</em> to be
religious here," she went on. "You must be
reduced&mdash;simply <em>reduced</em> to trusting in Providence!"</p>

<p>Mary Sidney smiled at the fire. "I didn't
have a trusting disposition. I didn't have even
a happy disposition, as you evidently remember."</p>

<p>"Well," returned Isabel, "it wasn't a bad
one: I didn't imply anything like that; but you
were one of the spoiled-beauty sort of girls, not
a bit cut out for hardship," the speaker looked
judicially at the once familiar face, softened
from its old brilliancy. "What an advantage it
is to have beautiful eyes!" she added bluntly.
"They don't desert you when other things go;&mdash;not
that it matters a bit what sort of eyes a
woman has, living the life you have."</p>

<p>"Oh, Allan thinks it does," returned Mary in
her restful manner.</p>

<p>"Does he appreciate you?" Mrs. Fabian
asked the question almost angrily.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sidney smiled. "We don't talk much
about that, but we're better companions, hap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>pier,
dearer, than we were twenty-five years
ago."</p>

<p>Her cousin gazed curiously. "Then it did
turn out all right. You've written so little
to your friends. How could your relatives tell?"</p>

<p>"You see, now, why," returned the other.
"There's not much letter-material here, and
even when we're living in town, all our friends
and our pursuits are so foreign to the people at
home. Little by little one gets out of the way of
writing."</p>

<p>"Don't you ever long for Fifth Avenue?"
asked Mrs. Fabian suddenly, her cousin's exile
impressing her more and more as utter forlornity.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, not for many years."</p>

<p>"You never could have kept your figure there
as you have here," admitted the other in a spirit
of justice. "I must say that," and the speaker
composed her own rigid armor into a less uncomfortable
position.</p>

<p>"Do your own housework, Isabel," advised
the hostess with a smile.</p>

<p>"Heavens! it is too late to talk to me about
that. I've enough to do without housework, I
should hope. You've no idea how much worse
things have grown in twenty-five years, Mary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
A woman has so much on her mind now that
nothing but regular massage from the crown
of her head to her heels will offset it. The
modistes and milliners are in a conspiracy to
change styles so often that it takes active
thought to keep abreast of them. Then you no
sooner settle down really to learn Bridge, for
instance, and feel that you can hold your own,
than everybody begins playing Auction! And
to know what people are talking about at luncheons
you must see plays, and skim through
books, reading at least enough so you can
express an opinion; not that anybody listens.
They all talk at once, their one and only object
seems to be to get their own ideas out of their
systems. I was glad to send Kathleen off to
school. It does seem as if the girls had to go
to college to escape as great a rush as we grownups
live in. Then when they come back, having
had another environment for four years, they
adjust themselves to their own homes with such
a sense of superiority that it makes you <em>tired</em>;
that's what it does, Mary, <em>tired</em>. I've had a
taste of it this summer. Kathleen has another
year to go, but already she is perfectly changed.
She cares no more for my advice, I assure you,
than if I had just come down from Mars and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
had no judgment as to the things of this world.
She's well-bred, of course,&mdash;I hope no daughter
of mine could be less than well-bred,&mdash;but when
I give her directions, or try to guide her in any
way, there's a twinkle in her eye that I resent,
Mary, I resent it distinctly. So there you are!"
Mrs. Fabian gestured with a perfectly kept
hand whereon a blazing gem flashed in the firelight.
"There we are between Scylla and Charybdis.
We either have to send our girls to college
and let the little upstarts think they've outgrown
us, or else have them rushed to death at
home, keep them up on tonics, and let them
sleep till noon!"</p>

<p>With this dismal peroration Mrs. Fabian sat
as far back in her chair as disciplined adipose
would permit, and shuddered again at the wind.</p>

<p>"Is a son an easier proposition then, in that
madding crowd of yours?"</p>

<p>"A boy does seem to have his life more
plainly mapped out than a girl. Edgar is in his
father's office." The speaker sighed unconsciously.
"What is your boy like, Mary?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Sidney kept silence for a thoughtful
moment before answering.</p>

<p>"He is like Pegasus harnessed to a coal-wagon,"
she said at last slowly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>"How very extraordinary. What do you
mean?"</p>

<p>Instead of replying, Mrs. Sidney went to a
table in the far corner of the cabin and brought
therefrom a portfolio which she opened on the
chair beside her guest.</p>

<p>A mass of sketches was disclosed,&mdash;charcoal,
water-color, oil. Mrs. Sidney lifted one, and
held it before the other's eyes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian raised her lorgnette.</p>

<p>"Why, it's you, Mary; and it's capital!"
she ejaculated.</p>

<p>Another and another sheet was offered for her
inspection.</p>

<p>"Why, they're all of you. The artist must be
in love with you."</p>

<p>Mary Sidney gave her a slight smile. "I hope
so, a little, but it was Hobson's choice when it
came to models. Phil seldom could get any one
beside me. Here's one of his father. He had to
do it slyly behind a newspaper, for Allan is
rather impatient of Phil's tendency."</p>

<p>"So that is what your boy is at! It's real
talent, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is," returned the mother with quiet
conviction.</p>

<p>"And where is he studying?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>"He has never studied anything but mining
engineering. He is working with his father
here."</p>

<p>The unconscious sadness of the speaker's tone
impressed her listener.</p>

<p>"He does landscapes, too," went on the mother,
lifting one after another of the sketches
of mountain, valley, and streamlet, "a little of
everything, you see." Mrs. Sidney regarded the
work wistfully.</p>

<p>"Why, they're lovely," declared Mrs. Fabian.
"Why don't you pin them up on the
walls?"</p>

<p>"Because it rather annoys Phil's father, to
see them, and it only tantalizes the boy."</p>

<p>"So Mr. Sidney isn't willing he should
study?"</p>

<p>"I don't think he would thwart us if he saw
any hope in it, but one can't enter on the life
of an art-student without any capital. Allan
knows there is a living for Phil in the work of
a mining engineer, so he has discouraged the
boy's talent."</p>

<p>"It is a great responsibility to thwart a
child's bent," declared Mrs. Fabian impressively.</p>

<p>"I have always felt so. I used to be very rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>less
and anxious about it. My husband seemed
to feel that because Phil was a strapping boy, a
natural athlete, that painting was a womanish
profession for him. He had the ability to help
him into mining engineering lines, and he always
pooh-poohed the idea of Phil's attempting
to be an artist." Mrs. Sidney gave a little
shrug. "We didn't have the money anyway, so
Allan naturally has had his way."</p>

<p>"One can't blame him," returned Mrs.
Fabian, who had relaxed as the wind ceased to
shake the cabin. "Painting is even more precarious
than acting; yet what a talent the boy
has!"</p>

<p>She held before her a bold sketch in charcoal
of the mountain-side in the winter&mdash;few in
strokes, but striking in its breadth and power.</p>

<p>"He has had an offer from a newspaper in
Denver to take the position of cartoonist. His
ability for caricature is good. See these of
Allan."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian laughed as she examined the
small sheets. "I haven't seen your husband for
ten years, Mary, but these recall his clean-cut
face better than a photograph would, I believe.
Phil rather gets back at his father in these,
doesn't he?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Allan laughed at them too. He's secretly
proud of Phil's cleverness, even while he
discourages it. He tells him it is all right for an
accomplishment, but a forlorn hope for a
living."</p>

<p>"And right he is," responded Mrs. Fabian,
laying down the sketches. "Look at Aunt
Mary's experience. There she has lived alone
all these years and given her life to the attempt
to make a name in the artistic world. I go
sometimes to see her, of course, for there she is
right in town, but her pictures"&mdash;Mrs. Fabian
lifted her eyes to the rafters&mdash;"they're
daubs!"</p>

<p>"I know," returned Mary Sidney, looking
back into the fire. "She sent me one on my last
birthday. She never forgets her name-child."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian laughed. "I fancy you wished
she would, for that time."</p>

<p>"No," returned the hostess, slowly, "I think
Aunt Mary sees more than she has the technique
to express. She gets an effect."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian raised her eyebrows. "She certainly
does. She makes me want to run a mile."</p>

<p>"The gift led to our having a little correspondence.
I sent her a couple of Phil's sketches
and she was delighted with them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>"She might well be," was the answer. There
was a brief silence, then the visitor continued:
"So Phil is something of a bone of contention
between you and his father?"</p>

<p>"It is our only difference. Yet it can scarcely
even be called that, because it is a fact that we
haven't the money to give him the start he
should have."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian looked at her cousin curiously.</p>

<p>"So this new calmness of yours&mdash;this repose.
It is resignation, at least, if not despair."</p>

<p>Mary Sidney smiled at the fire. "No," she
returned, "I told you. It is faith."</p>

<p>"Religion?"</p>

<p>"Yes, religion. Not the sort of ideas we were
brought up in, Isabel. Something quite different."</p>

<p>"What is it, then? Where did you find it?"</p>

<p>"It found me."</p>

<p>"How mysterious! Is that wind coming up
again, Mary?"</p>

<p>"How it blew that night!" said Mary Sidney
thoughtfully, still looking into the fire. "It was
just before Thanksgiving, I remember, five
years ago. Allan and I had come up to the mine,
Phil had gone back to college, and one night a
belated traveller, overtaken by the storm which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
came up as suddenly as this, stopped at the door
and asked if he could stay all night with us. He
was one of these vital men, full of energy, who
seem to exhale good cheer. Allan thoroughly
enjoyed a talk with him that evening, and when
we went to bed I remember his sighing and remarking
that a man must be either a fool or a
philosopher who could keep such an optimistic
outlook on life as this Mr. Tremaine. I returned
that perhaps our guest had struck a
gold-mine here in the mountains, and I remember
how Allan grumbled&mdash;'Either that, or the
pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.'</p>

<p>"Allan came in here once, where we had left
the guest to sleep on the couch, to see if he
wanted anything; and he found him reading in
front of the embers. When he came back he
remarked: 'That fellow has a smile that doesn't
usually last beyond the tenth year.' The next
morning dawned bright and our guest was in
haste to depart. He tried in the nicest way to
pay us for taking in a stranger, and we quite
honestly told him that if any money were to
pass it should go from us to him for cheering our
exile. He took from his pocket a small black
book and held it out to me. 'Then,' he said,
'may I leave with you a little book which has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
broken up the clouds of life for me, and let the
light stream through? You have time up here
to read,&mdash;and to think?' He made the addition
with that smile which had roused Allan's
curiosity, shook hands with us both, thanked
us again, mounted his horse and rode away. We
never saw him afterward. I often wish I knew
where he was, that I might thank him."</p>

<p>"What was the book?" asked Mrs. Fabian,
impressed by the fervor of the other's tone.</p>

<p>"A&mdash;a commentary on the Bible. A new
light on the meaning of the Bible."</p>

<p>"How queer! I'm sure I thought our family
knew as much about the Bible as the average of
decent people."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian's tone was slightly resentful.</p>

<p>"We did," returned Mary Sidney.</p>

<p>"So that's what you meant a few minutes
ago by the calm of faith."</p>

<p>Mrs. Sidney nodded. "I know now what
that sentence means: 'Cast your burden on the
Lord.' Phil is the most precious thing on earth
to me. The years seem to be slipping by without
showing us a possible path to what we wish.
'Wait patiently on the Lord' doesn't mean
inaction either. I've learned that. I know
that at the right time&mdash;the right moment&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>circumstances
will arise to show us if Phil
is to&mdash;"</p>

<p>A sudden blast of wind brought a start and a
muffled exclamation from the guest, and at the
same instant a stamping sounded outside. The
lamp-flames rose wildly, and smoked in the instant
of opening the door wide enough to admit
the lithe form of a man whose shoulders and
soft felt hat glistened with snow. He quickly
closed the door and stamped again, taking off
the hat from his short damp locks and shaking
it vigorously.</p>

<p>"Phil, this is my cousin, Mrs. Fabian," said
Mrs. Sidney. "You used to call her Aunt Isabel
when you were a little chap and we went to visit
her once. Do you remember?"</p>

<p>"When a cousin is once removed she becomes
an aunt," declared Mrs. Fabian, looking the
young man over with approval.</p>

<p>"My hand is too wet to shake," he said,
meeting her interested gaze, his own luminous
in the firelight.</p>

<p>"Lucky boy! You have your mother's eyes!"
she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Mary Sidney; "Phil's are
blue."</p>

<p>"Dark with terror, then!" exclaimed Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Fabian, again anxious. "Isn't the storm
frightful?"</p>

<p>Phil's amused glance sought his mother's.</p>

<p>"It's sort of spitting outside," he returned,
unbuttoning his corduroy coat.</p>

<p>"You're making fun of a tenderfoot," said
Mrs. Fabian, watching his keen face admiringly.
"Don't pretend. What have you done
with my poor innocent husband?"</p>

<p>"He'll be up here in a few minutes with my
poor innocent father who has been showing him
why he'll never be a millionaire out of that
mine."</p>

<p>"What do I care if he isn't, so long as he
isn't lost in this storm!"</p>

<p>"I came on ahead because the mail had just
been brought in." As he spoke, the young man
brought a small bunch of letters and papers
from an inner pocket.</p>

<p>"A great excitement, Isabel," said the hostess.
"Only twice a week, you know."</p>

<p>"There's another letter from the Denver
paper," went on Phil, looking at his mother
steadily.</p>

<p>"You'll forgive us if we open everything,
won't you, Isabel?" asked Mrs. Sidney.</p>

<p>"Indeed, yes. Don't mind me." Mrs. Fabian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
returned to her chair by the fire and regarded
the pair who seated themselves by the table.</p>

<p>Phil had slipped off the damp coat, and his
arm in its striped linen sleeve was thrown
around his mother's shoulders.</p>

<p>The visitor's eyes filled with something like
envy. Kathleen and Edgar were her step-children,
the boy had been five years of age
when she began to be, to use her own declaration,
the best stepmother in the world. Edgar
would never think of reading his letters with
her in this frankly affectionate attitude. Must
one live on a mountain-top, she wondered, to
win the sort of look she had seen in this son's
eyes?</p>

<p>"I've been showing your Aunt Isabel your
sketches, Phil," said Mrs. Sidney, holding open
a letter they had just read. "I told her about
the Denver paper. This is another offer from
them, Isabel, an increased offer."</p>

<p>"I'm sure that's very flattering," returned
Mrs. Fabian.</p>

<p>Phil did not speak. His straight brows were
knit in perplexity, and his lips were set in the
look of longing that his mother knew.</p>

<p>"I don't know this writing from New York,"
said Mrs. Sidney, opening the next letter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Glancing over it she gave a startled exclamation.</p>

<p>"Whew!" breathed the boy, reading over her
shoulder. "Poor Aunt Mary!"</p>

<p>"Isabel, Aunt Mary has gone!" exclaimed
Mrs. Sidney.</p>

<p>"What! I didn't know she was ill. She
wasn't ill. Who is there to attend to things?
Who wrote you?"</p>

<p>"Eliza Brewster. This is from her. It was
very sudden. She had been at work at her easel
an hour before. How sad it seems! How lonely!
I wish we had both been there, Isabel. There is
the letter." Phil took it across to Mrs. Fabian.
"You see. She was buried day before yesterday.
Oh, I'm glad we had that little interchange
in the summer. Eliza loves her, but,
after all, she is not her own."</p>

<p>Phil mechanically opened another letter. His
thoughts were with that unknown relative with
cravings like to his, working through the gathering
years toward a goal which had ever retreated
before her. He unfolded a business
letter. It enclosed a small sealed envelope
addressed to himself in another handwriting.</p>

<p>"Aunt Mary's!" said his mother. The son's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
arm was again around her as with heads close
together they perused the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Grand-Nephew, Philip Sidney</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p>When you open this letter, I shall have gone
to a world where surely I shall be permitted to
come nearer to the source of beauty.</p>

<p>My family all consider me a failure. I know
it. They have laughed at my poor efforts. I
know it; but since your mother wrote to me a
month ago, sending me your sketches and telling
me your longings, I have felt that out in the
free Western country, there lives one with my
blood in his veins, who will understand the
thirst that has led me on, and nerved me to untiring
effort&mdash;that has made it my only hope
of happiness to live as I have lived, and work as
I have worked. He will also understand, perhaps,
that few as my rewards have been, I have
occasionally felt that some beauty has crept
through my brain and been fixed to the canvas,
and that such moments have given me the
highest bliss this world could bestow.</p>

<p>For a month, then, I have taken comfort in
my artist-boy, no matter if you are known to
others as an engineer. I have kept on my easel
the photograph your mother sent me, and every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
day while I work, I look from time to time into
your eyes, your mother's lovely eyes. I rejoice
in your thick hair, and your splendid chin and
firm, full-curved mouth. It isn't often that a
head wanders from the Louvre and becomes
set on a pair of modern shoulders. I, the old
woman, peering through her spectacles, and
painting with a hand that is often far from
steady, have found a joy in studying the harmony
of your promise. You have my blood in
your veins, but you will succeed where I have
failed. A happy failure, Philip. Don't feel sad
for me. I've had moments of joy that no one
knew. No one took the trouble to know; but
nobody is to blame. Lives are very full in these
rushing days.</p>

<p>I believe in you, and I long for you to get
started toward that land where you fain would
be. Your mother says that the door hasn't
opened yet. Looking into your young eyes, a
great thought came to me. Supposing I, the
ineffectual, could set that door ajar! With the
thought came the first great regret for my poverty.
Never mind, thought I stoutly; if I can
set that door a wee bit open, his young strength
can do the rest!</p>

<p>I have had warnings that soon the great door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
will be opened for me; the door that ushers in to
the heart's desire. Mine has been for Truth
and Beauty, O God, Thou knowest!</p>

<p>So I am making my will&mdash;such a poor little
short will; but all for you, my kindred spirit,
my knight who will deliver from failure, my
Philip Sidney.</p>

<p>The faithful maid Eliza will take care of my
effects for you. You will find some useful things
among the paraphernalia here. I look at my
old easel and wonder if it will ever be promoted
to hold a canvas of yours.</p>

<p>This letter will be enclosed to you in one from
my lawyer, telling you the business side of my
wishes. The heart side no one can tell. I swell
with longing for your success, and happiness;
and so good-bye.</p>

<p>The mother who never had a son, gains one
in you. The painter who never was an artist,
becomes one in you!</p>

<p>And so, dear, I am your happy</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Aunt Mary</span>.
</p></div>

<p>Mary Sidney and her boy exchanged a look.
With unsteady hands Phil straightened the
legal letter, and they read it together. Then
they rose from the table with one accord.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian, wrapped in thought, looked up
at the sudden movement.</p>

<p>Phil's concentrated gaze went past her to the
fire, and he stood motionless, one hand leaning
on the table, the other arm around his mother.
Mary Sidney clasped the rustling paper to her
breast. All the self-forgetfulness of mother-love
shone in her wet eyes as she met Mrs. Fabian's
questioning look.</p>

<p>"Isabel, I told you it would come," she said.
"I told you we should know. The light is here.
Phil is going to New York."</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">SEVERED COMPANIONSHIP</p>


<p>Eliza Brewster could count on the fingers of
one hand the number of times that tears had
escaped her pale eyes. She had always felt for
those who wept easily, the same leniency without
comprehension that she entertained for
women who fainted.</p>

<p>Trials had come and gone in her life; but
never, since the day when she discovered some
boys maltreating her cat, had she shed such
tears as flowed now in her sorrow. The cat's
abbreviated tail bore witness still to that day's
conflict, but both his wound and hers had
healed.</p>

<p>When would this new wound cease to ache
and palpitate! Each day there in the lonely
flat, Eliza Brewster renewed war with the memories
to which she had no mind to succumb.
The gentleness of her mistress, her innocent,
ever-springing hope, her constant disappointments,
the solitariness of her narrow life, the
neglect of her relatives&mdash;all these things re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>curred
to the faithful handmaiden with the
terrific appeal which contracts the newly bereft
heart, causing it to bleed afresh. Mary Ballard,
in spite of her twenty years' greater age, had
been child as well as mistress to the faithful
woman, who cared for the quiet, shy dreamer
of dreams through the twenty-five years of the
latter's widowhood.</p>

<p>Now Eliza's occupation was gone. All her
rather hard philosophy, all her habitual self-possession,
was swamped in a world where she
could no longer call her dear one from the easel
to her meals; and where the rooms of the little
apartment grew spacious and echoed from sheer
emptiness.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ballard had bequeathed her maid all her
clothing, and all her personal possessions, save
one old-fashioned diamond brooch, which was
to be sent to her namesake, Mary Sidney. Some
weeks before her death, she told Eliza of the disposition
of her effects. In referring to the small
gift of money which was to be hers, she said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I wish it were more, Eliza, but," looking
wistfully into the eyes of her companion, "I
have a great mission for my little capital as I
have told you. If only the amount were as great
as the object!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nonsense, talking about wills," rejoined
Eliza brusquely, a new delicacy in the loved
face making her tone sharp, "more likely I'll
be leaving something to you; though I don't
know what it would be, unless 'twas the cat."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ballard smiled. "Not a bad legacy,"
she replied. "Pluto is very sympathetic. He
likes to watch me paint. He has really concluded
to endure the smell of oil and turpentine
just to keep me company."</p>

<p>At the moment the night-black cat was lifting
green eyes of approval to his own portrait
which stood near, and Mrs. Ballard buried a
veined hand in his glossy fur. A few weeks later
that hand was still. Oh, the dear garments with
the outline of the wearer still warm in their
curves! Who has not known the tender, overpowering
anguish of their touch? Every day
Eliza tried to systematize and pack her new
belongings, and every day she postponed the
ordeal until to-morrow.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ballard's watch alone stood on the table
at the head of her bed, hanging in the little
satin slipper just as it had ticked beside her
mistress's sleeping form so many years. The
watch seemed as alive as Pluto, and almost as
much of a companion. It spoke eloquently of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the gentle being who had always been unconscious
of its warnings.</p>

<p>On the mantelpiece in the living-room, which
had been studio as well, was Philip Sidney's
photograph and his two sketches, one of his
mother, and one of a storm-beaten tree. They
were the two that Mary Sidney had sent in
response to her aunt's gift in the summer-time.
All three pictures were turned now to the wall.
Mrs. Sidney was a relative. That stamped her
for Eliza. The sketches had been either the
vainglorious gift of a fond mamma, or else
prompted by hope of the very result they had
gained. As for the photograph of the artist,
Eliza could not deny that it had marvellously
cheered and companioned the last months of
her dear one's life.</p>

<p>Indeed, in those days, recent yet already
seeming so long past, Eliza, out in her kitchen,
had often laughed grimly to herself at the infatuation
for the picture shown by her mistress.</p>

<p>"If she was sixteen she couldn't be more
head over heels in love," she would soliloquize.
"I s'pose an artist has got to be just so stirred
up by good looks, whether it's a landscape or a
human; but I know I wouldn't trust a hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>some
man around the corner with a dog's
dinner."</p>

<p>In pursuance of these reflections, when her
mistress had gone, Phil's picture went with the
sketches, his face to the wall.</p>

<p>Eliza's attitude toward the whole world was
defiance on the subject of her mistress's lifework.
Of course, Mrs. Ballard was an artist; a
great artist. Eliza knew it must be so, there
were so many of her pictures that she could not
understand.</p>

<p>A canvas which was a blur to her contained
so much which the painter would explain while
Eliza stood devotedly by, dutifully assenting to
the unravelling of the snarl of form and color.</p>

<p>"You don't care for it, do you, Eliza?" the
artist would say sometimes, wistfully.</p>

<p>"Indeed, I do, Mrs. Ballard," would come
the response, and never words rang more
prompt and true. "I'm just one o' those folks
so practical, I can't see an inch before my nose
and I've never had advantages. I haven't got
any insight, as you call it, beyond a dishpan;
but when you explain it so clear, that's when I
begin to see."</p>

<p>This latter was a loyal lie; as a rule, Eliza
never did see; but she applauded just the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
with vague murmurs of wonder and admiration.</p>

<p>It hurt the faithful soul even now to recall
how, when the sketches came from the West,
her mistress had eagerly examined them, and
bitten her lip, her eyes glistening. "There's the
true touch, Eliza," she had said quietly. "This
boy has a spark of the divine fire."</p>

<p>"Pooh! I don't think so at all," Eliza had
returned stoutly and contemptuously. "Of
course, that drawin' of his mother is pleasant
enough, but you haven't seen her in years.
You don't know how good the likeness is; and
as for that landscape, that rough twisted tree
most blown off its feet and clouds racin' above
those rocks, nobody'd ever think they was anything
except just what they are, a tree and rocks
and clouds; awful pokerish, I call it, not a bit
pretty." Eliza's long nose lifted in scorn.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ballard smiled and bowed her head over
the wind-blown tree.</p>

<p>"My flesh and blood, still," she murmured.</p>

<p>Now, in the dreary days, Eliza moved about
aimlessly, forgetting to eat, and roused only by
Pluto's indignant <em>meows</em>, to remember that,
though he might mourn, still he felt that he
owed it to himself to keep his coat glossy by
milk baths, taken internally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Never had he known such long luxurious naps
in the lap of his mistress as now. Wrapped in
thought she sat for hours without moving; the
irrepressible tears welling up from her heart and
creeping, one by one, down her thin cheeks.</p>

<p>She had made no friends in the cheap apartment
building where they lived. It was a changing
population, which ebbed and flowed at the
mercy of its own financial tide.</p>

<p>"There ain't a lady in this house except you,"
Eliza had been wont to say to her mistress.</p>

<p>"I don't believe we know that," Mrs. Ballard
had rejoined; "but we're too busy for neighboring,
aren't we, Eliza?"</p>

<p>Whenever there had been any leisure, Mrs.
Ballard had taken her handmaiden to the
Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>

<p>Not for worlds would Eliza mar the joy with
which her mistress bestowed upon her this
treat. So she climbed endless stairs, and
plodded weary miles with fortitude, having
ready a response to every worshipful utterance
with which Mrs. Ballard pointed out this and
that marvel.</p>

<p>"Wonderful, ain't it!" Eliza would respond
with the regularity of clockwork.</p>

<p>"How I love to get you out of that kitchen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Eliza, up into this atmosphere of genius!" her
mistress would say, in a burst of affection for
the strong mainspring of her household.</p>

<p>"Wonderful, ain't it!" returned the beneficiary,
stepping on the other foot in the effort to
rest one leg.</p>

<p>The sight of the very exterior of the great
repository of art-treasures caused Eliza's bones
to ache, if she caught sight of the imposing pile
from a car window.</p>

<p>One day, however, all this was changed. The
Metropolitan Museum of Art rose in Eliza's
estimation to the level of her own kitchen where
a chromo depicting kittens in various attitudes
of abandon hung over the table.</p>

<p>Mistress and maid were doing the well-worn
circuit. The faithful echo had repeated "Wonderful,
ain't it!" for the twentieth time. The
ardor in Mrs. Ballard's eyes was lending wings
to her slender body, but Eliza had lagged,
spurred on, and rested the other leg, until, to
paraphrase a bit from Mr. Lowell&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">"On which leg she felt the worse,</div>
    <div class="verse">She couldn't 'a' told you, 'nother,"&mdash;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>when suddenly an inspiration of deliverance
seized her. The fact that it had not seized her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
months before was simply another proof of devotion
to the sun of her existence. Each time
she entered the massive gates to her place of
torture, she left such mentality as she possessed
behind her. As well might a fish be expected
to navigate in the free air of heaven as Eliza
in these marble halls. This was her mistress's
element. Let her guide. But one memorable
day the two were standing before a marine.</p>

<p>"Oh, Eliza, that's new!" exclaimed Mrs.
Ballard; and from the vigor of her tone, her
handmaid feared the worst. She had believed
they were nearly ready to depart. Now her
companion seemed inspired for another two
hours.</p>

<p>"Might it not have been painted from your
island," continued Mrs. Ballard. "What adorable
work!"</p>

<p>"Wonderful, ain't it!" came Eliza's wooden
accents.</p>

<p>"What feeling!" murmured her rapt companion.</p>

<p>"I only hope 'tain't sciatica," thought
Eliza, wiggling her hip. Her casually roving eye
caught sight of one vacancy on the bench in the
middle of the room.</p>

<p>"Don't you want to sit down a spell and look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
at it, Mrs. Ballard?" she asked. "There's a
place."</p>

<p>"No," was the slow, absent reply. "I seem
to prefer to stand in its presence&mdash;a royal
presence, Eliza."</p>

<p>Miss Brewster waited no longer. With incontinent
haste she limped, as in seven-league
boots, toward the desired haven. She saw that
a portly gentleman was heading for the same
spot. She sprinted. She beat him by a toe's
length, and nearly received him on her maiden
lap. He recovered himself and glared at her.
She maintained an unconscious air, her gaze
fixed on the sky of the marine painting. It was
all she could see; there were so many standing
in front of her, welcoming this new treasure to
the home of beauty.</p>

<p>Presently Mrs. Ballard, missing her shadow,
looked about and at last descried Eliza. She
approached, her small, veined hands clasped on
her breast for joy.</p>

<p>"It seems as if it must have been done from
the island!" she exclaimed. "How can you sit
down, Eliza! I should think it would take you
straight to your old home!"</p>

<p>Miss Brewster did not say that she thought
there was more likelihood of her again seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
her native place if she did sit down; but for
once her clockwork did not act. It seemed as if
the succumbing of her legs had impeded the
other mechanism.</p>

<p>"I just felt as if I had to, Mrs. Ballard," she
answered numbly.</p>

<p>"You dear!" exclaimed her mistress impulsively,
speaking low. "I might have known it.
You felt overcome. I don't wonder. It took me
back to the island, too, in a flash! I dare say
you often conceal homesickness from me, Eliza.
We must try to go there next summer! I did
use to think that perhaps Mrs. Fabian&mdash;but,
no matter; we can go on our own account,
Eliza, and we will, too."</p>

<p>"It would be lots better for you than staying
here in summer, that's sure."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ballard sighed, "Yes, if only the rent
didn't keep on, and keep on."</p>

<p>Eliza knew the arguments. She did not pursue
the subject now. She rose, keeping firm
pressure, however, against the bench.</p>

<p>"Take this place, Mrs. Ballard, and rest a
minute."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not a bit tired. I thought we'd take
one or two more rooms. The light is wonderful
to-day."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Up to the present moment Eliza in this temple
of genius had, as has been said, galvanized
her energies and followed where her mistress led,
at any cost, as unquestioningly as the needle
follows the magnet; but this was the moment
of her emancipation. Mrs. Ballard herself gave
her the cue, for she added with consideration
for an unwonted sentiment:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Unless you'd rather stay and look at that
reminder of home a while longer, Eliza? I'll
come back for you."</p>

<p>"Oh, would you, just as soon, Mrs. Ballard?"</p>

<p>The eagerness of the tone touched her mistress.</p>

<p>"Why, of course, my dear, do so; but I'd get
up if I were you." Eliza had sunk back upon
the bench with the certainty and impact of a
pile-driver. "There is such a crowd you can't
see anything from here but the sky."</p>

<p>"I feel as if I could look at that sky for a
week," responded Eliza with a sincerity which
admitted of no doubt.</p>

<p>"It is wonderful, isn't it?" returned her
mistress, unconscious of plagiarism. She patted
Eliza's shoulder. "I'll be back soon," she assured
her, and moved away.</p>

<p>"The good creature!" she thought. "How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
selfish I have been to her! I ought occasionally
to let her go home; but I know she'd never
go without me. She wouldn't believe that I'd
eat three meals a day, no matter how faithfully
I promised." And Mrs. Ballard laughed
a little before becoming engrossed in an old
favorite.</p>

<p>She was gone so long that Eliza cogitated
with newly acquired ingenuity.</p>

<p>"It's a good thing," she reflected, "that the
fool-catcher ain't artistic. He'd 'a' caught me
here lots o' times. Supposin' I was with that
dear crazy critter all this time, hoppin' along
in misery, or standin' in front o' some paintin'
like a stork." Eliza's light eyes twinkled.
"Why shouldn't I set up a taste in pictures,
too? Just watch me from this on."</p>

<p>After this day Mrs. Ballard did observe with
joy a transformation in her handmaid's attitude.
When they visited the galleries Eliza
would move along with her usual calm until
suddenly some picture would particularly hold
her attention.</p>

<p>"Is that a very fine paintin'?" she would ask
of her cicerone.</p>

<p>"Which one, Eliza? Oh, yes, I see. Certainly,
or it wouldn't be here; but in that next room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
are those I thought we should make a study of
to-day."</p>

<p>Eliza's light eyes swept the unbroken polished
surface of the floor of the adjoining room.
"I know I haven't got very far along in understandin'
these things," she said modestly, "but
to my eyes there is a certain somethin' there,"&mdash;she
paused and let her transfixed gaze toward
the chosen picture say the rest.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ballard held her lip between her teeth
reflectively as she looked at it too. On that first
occasion it was a summer landscape painted at
sunset.</p>

<p>"We've passed it many times," she thought,
"but it's evident that Eliza is waking up!"</p>

<p>The reflection was exultant. Far be it from
Mrs. Ballard to interrupt the birth throes of her
companion's artistic consciousness.</p>

<p>"Then stay right here, Eliza, as long as you
wish," she replied sympathetically. "I shall be
near by."</p>

<p>She hurried away in her light-footed fashion,
and Eliza continued to stand before her cynosure
long enough to disarm possible suspicion,
and then backed thoughtfully away until she
reached a bench upon which she sank, still with
eyes upon the picture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Ballard from the next room observed her
trance.</p>

<p>"She is waking up. Her eyes are opening,
bless her heart," she thought. "Constant
dropping does wear the stone."</p>

<p>Eliza would have paraphrased the proverb
and declared that constant dropping saves the
life.</p>

<p>From this day on she professed, and triumphantly
acted upon, an appreciation for certain
pictures; and Mrs. Ballard marvelled with
pride at the catholicity of her taste; for such
serpentine wisdom did Eliza display in passing,
unseeing, many an inviting bench, that never,
to their last pilgrimage to Mrs. Ballard's mecca,
did the latter suspect the source of her companion's
modest enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Poor thing," thought Eliza during these
periods of rest; "it's a sin and a shame that she
hasn't got anybody worthy to come with her.
If those relatives of hers were, any of 'em, fit to
live, one of 'em would bring her here sometimes.
The poor dear, as long as she hasn't a soul but
an ignorant country body like me to sympathize
with her, I've got to do my best; and
really if I set a spell once in a while, I'll have
more sprawl and can seem to enjoy it more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
It's awful hard when you can't think of anything
but your joints! I'm younger'n she is,
and I'm ashamed o' gettin' so tuckered; but
she's got some kind o' wings that seem to lift
her along."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ballard, from the next room, caught
Eliza's eye, smiled, and nodded, well pleased.
So the era of peace ensued; and when Miss
Brewster caught sight from a street car of the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, she was able to
regard it without a frown.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">MRS. FABIAN'S VISIT</p>


<p>Eliza was not obliged to give up the apartment
until the end of the month. Hence her drifting
from day to day, and Pluto's naps in the lap of
luxury.</p>

<p>All her energy and systematic habits were in
a state of suspension. Her clocks ran down.
The watch in the tiny satin slipper beside her
bed alone ticked the minutes away, and when
Eliza wound it her eyes were too wet to see the
time. Night fell and she went to bed. Morning
dawned and she arose. She drank tea, but it
was too much trouble to eat.</p>

<p>One day the bell rang. At first she determined
not to answer it. Then second thought
came to her. What was she waiting here for
except to answer the bell? Was her next duty
not to introduce the usurper into his kingdom&mdash;to
give into his desecrating hands those
objects,&mdash;easel, palette, brushes, paints,&mdash;hallowed
by her dear one's use? At the sound
of a knock she hastened to fling open the door.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Mrs. Fabian, elegantly gowned and furred,
stood before her.</p>

<p>Eliza gazed at this apparition dumb.</p>

<p>"Why, Eliza Brewster," exclaimed the visitor
with concern, "I scarcely knew you."
After the mutual gaze of astonishment the
caller moved in with her air of stately assurance,
and Eliza followed her perforce into the
living-room. Here Mrs. Fabian swiftly examined
the possibilities of the scanty chairs,
then seated herself in the largest.</p>

<p>"You have been ill, too, Eliza? You look
like a ghost!"</p>

<p>The gaunt woman in the alpaca dress, so
filled with resentment that she begrudged her
own tears because they informed this "relative"
of her grief, stood in silence with a beating
heart.</p>

<p>"Sit down, you poor creature," went on Mrs.
Fabian, unsuspecting hidden fires.</p>

<p>They burned higher at the tone of patronage,
but Eliza, weakened from mourning and lack of
food, felt her knees trembling and sank into the
nearest chair.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian, genuinely touched by the
ravages she saw, broke the silence that followed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>"I was greatly surprised and shocked to hear
of Aunt Mary's sudden going."</p>

<p>She began to feel uncomfortable under the
set gaze of Eliza's swollen eyes.</p>

<p>"I suppose you sent to my house at once, and
found that Mr. Fabian and I were in the far
West."</p>

<p>"No, I didn't think of sending," returned
Eliza.</p>

<p>"You should have done so. Surely there was
no one nearer to Aunt Mary than I."</p>

<p>"It was in the paper," said Eliza dully.</p>

<p>"Had I been here I should, of course, have
taken charge of the funeral."</p>

<p>The pale eyes emitted a curious light.</p>

<p>"No, you wouldn't, Mrs. Fabian," was the
quiet reply.</p>

<p>"Why do you say that?"</p>

<p>"Because the time for you to have done
something for Mrs. Ballard was while she was
alive."</p>

<p>Eliza was too spent physically to speak other
than softly, but her words brought the amazed
color to her visitor's face.</p>

<p>"You are presuming," Mrs. Fabian said,
after a moment. "What do you know about
it? I suppose Aunt Mary did not think it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
worth while to tell you all the things I did for
her."</p>

<p>"No," agreed Eliza, "she never said a word
about the times you came with your automobile
to take her riding; nor the picture exhibitions
you took her to see, or the way you had
her to dinner Thanksgivin' time and other
times, or how you had her to spend part o' the
summer with you at the island, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Eliza Brewster, what does this mean!" Mrs.
Fabian's eyes were dilated. "Aunt Mary was
not related to my husband or to his children.
I never expected him to marry my family."</p>

<p>Miss Brewster's gaze was fixed upon the
speaker with pale scorn, but the latter continued
with what she endeavored to make a dignified
defence. "I always sent Aunt Mary a
present at Christmas."</p>

<p>"Yes," interrupted Eliza. "Last season
'twas a paper-cutter. You gave her cuts
enough without that."</p>

<p>"And I called upon her at intervals," continued
the visitor in a heightened tone to drown
the small voice.</p>

<p>"Intervals of a year," said Eliza.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian started to rise, but bethought
herself, and sank back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are impertinent," she said coldly. "A
person in your position cannot understand the
duties of one in mine. There can be no discussion
between you and me." The speaker stirred
in her chair and collected herself. "I&mdash;and
every one of Aunt Mary's relatives&mdash;appreciate
your faithful service to her, and thank you
for it."</p>

<p>"Don't you dare!" ejaculated Eliza, with
such sudden belligerency that Mrs. Fabian
started.</p>

<p>"You're almost crazed with fatigue and grief,
poor creature," she said at last. "I can see that
you are scarcely responsible for what you say
to-day. You must take a long rest. Shall you
go home to the island or take another place in
town? I can find you one."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian felt the superiority of her own
self-control as she made this kind offer; besides,
in these troublous days with servants, steady,
reliable Eliza, with a sure touch in cookery, was
not to be despised. The visitor accompanied
her offer with a soothing attempt at a smile.</p>

<p>Eliza had relapsed into dullness. "I won't
trouble you," she said.</p>

<p>"It would not be any trouble," was the
magnanimous reply. "Just let me know any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
time when you would like a reference, Eliza. It
will give me pleasure to reward your faithfulness."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian loved approval quite as much as
she did admiration. She would feel much more
comfortable to win that of even this uncompromising,
cranky individual, so lined with the
signs of suffering. As Eliza Brewster was a
native of the island where Mrs. Fabian had
resorted from the days of her girlhood, she had
a very slight but old acquaintance with this
woman. As she glanced at the thin hair, now
fast turning grey, the sunken eyes and cheeks,
and the bony, roughened hands, she shuddered
beneath her ermine-lined sables, to remember
that she and Eliza Brewster were about the
same age. She passed a white-gloved hand over
the firm contour of her smooth cheek as if to
make sure of its firmness. "I believe it was I
who recommended you to Aunt Mary in the
first place, long ago," she added.</p>

<p>"That's one o' your mistakes," said Eliza
drily.</p>

<p>"On the contrary," returned Mrs. Fabian
graciously. She was determined to warm this
forlorn specimen of New England frigidity into
something humanly companionable, else how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
was she going to attain the object of her visit?
She went on with such flattery of manner as she
might have employed toward a desirable dbutante.
"It has proved quite the best thing
that I ever did for Aunt Mary; securing her
comfort and thereby the peace of mind of all
who belonged to her. Don't call it a mistake,
Eliza."</p>

<p>"However that may be," returned the other
immovably, "'t wa'n't you that did it. 'Twas
your Cousin Mary."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;was it? Oh, indeed?" responded Mrs.
Fabian, slipping back her furs still further.
Eliza Brewster's disagreeable manner was making
her nervous. "Yes, I believe Mrs. Sidney
was with us on her wedding-trip just at that
time. Mr. Fabian and I have just returned
from visiting Mrs. Sidney out in her wild
mountain home."</p>

<p>Eliza's eyes roved involuntarily to two blank
sheets of board standing on the mantelpiece;
but she was silent.</p>

<p>"Do you know the contents of Aunt Mary's
will, Eliza?" asked Mrs. Fabian, after waiting
vainly for an inquiry as to her cousin's well-being.</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you think of it?"</p>

<p>"That don't matter, does it?"</p>

<p>A streak of light illumined Mrs. Fabian's
annoyance. Ah, that was what was the matter
with Eliza. After twenty-five years of faithful
service, she had expected to inherit her mistress's
few hundreds. Full explanation, this, of
the present sullenness. The disappointment
must, indeed, have been bitter.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian felt an impulse of genuine sympathy.
She knew the singular loneliness of
Eliza's situation; knew that she had no near
kin, and the transplanting from the island home
had been complete. What an outlook now, was
Eliza Brewster's!</p>

<p>"Perhaps the will was as much of a surprise
to you as it was to the rest of us," Mrs. Fabian
went on. "The Sidneys were amazed. They
didn't tell me just how much Aunt Mary left
young Mr. Sidney. Do you know?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Eliza promptly.</p>

<p>And again Mrs. Fabian looked at her interrogatively.
As well question the Sphinx. She
comprehended the stony closing of the thin lips.
There might be a combination which would
make them open, but she did not have it. She
shrugged her fine-cloth shoulders. "Oh, well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
it doesn't matter. It must have been very
little, anyway."</p>

<p>She sighed. She must get at her business,
though she dreaded absurdly to introduce it.
"Well, Eliza, if you will take me to Aunt
Mary's room, I will go through her belongings.
It is always the most painful duty connected
with a death, but it cannot be escaped."</p>

<p>Eliza stared at her, speechless.</p>

<p>"Aunt Mary had a few very nice things,"
went on Mrs. Fabian. She tried to smile as at
a loving memory. "The regulation treasures of
a dear old lady,&mdash;her diamond ring, a diamond
brooch, and a camel's hair shawl&mdash;My
heavens!" cried the visitor, interrupting herself
suddenly with a shriek of terror. "Take it
away! Take it away!"</p>

<p>She clung to the back of her chair; for Pluto,
silent as a shadow, had sprung upon the ends of
her pelerine as they lay in her lap and was
daintily nosing the fur, while perilously grasping
its richness, his eyes glowing with excitement.
Eliza rose, and sweeping him into one
arm resumed her seat.</p>

<p>"Oh, how that frightened me!" Mrs. Fabian
panted and looked angrily at the animal with
the jetty coat and abbreviated tail, whose eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
live emeralds, expanded and contracted as they
glowed still upon the coveted fur.</p>

<p>If she expected an apology, none came.
Eliza's pale face showed no emotion. Endurance
was written in every line.</p>

<p>"To be interrupted at such a critical moment!"
Mrs. Fabian felt it was unbearable.</p>

<p>"Let me see"&mdash;she began again with a
little laugh. "Your pet knocked everything
out of my head, Eliza. Oh, yes, I was saying
that I will look over Aunt Mary's things
now."</p>

<p>She rose as she spoke. Eliza kept her seat.</p>

<p>"You can't do that, Mrs. Fabian."</p>

<p>"I certainly shall, Eliza Brewster. What do
you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean that they're mine. She left 'em all
to me."</p>

<p>The speaker struggled to control the trembling
of her lips.</p>

<p>The visitor looked the limp black alpaca
figure over, haughtily.</p>

<p>"Aunt Mary left you her diamond ring, her
diamond brooch, and her camel's hair shawl?"
she asked sceptically.</p>

<p>"She left her diamond brooch to her namesake,
Mrs. Sidney. I sent it to her a week ago."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then, since you know Aunt Mary's wishes,
what did she leave me? The ring?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am!"</p>

<p>"The shawl?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian's nostrils dilated.</p>

<p>"My aunt's poor trifles are nothing to me, of
course, except for sentiment's sake," she said
haughtily.</p>

<p>Eliza bowed her bitter face over Pluto's fur.</p>

<p>"I am quite sure, however, that she did not
pass away without some mention of me,&mdash;her
sister's child."</p>

<p>"She did, though, Mrs. Fabian. If it's a
keepsake you want," added Eliza drily, "you
may have the paper-cutter. It's never been
out o' the box."</p>

<p>The visitor, still standing, eyed the other
with compressed lips before she spoke:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have told you that I don't consider you
responsible to-day. You are half-crazed, and
I'm sorry for you. Answer me this, however,
and mind, I shall verify your words by a visit to
Mrs. Ballard's lawyer. Did my aunt leave you,
legally, all her personal possessions?"</p>

<p>"She did."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian maintained another space of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
silence, gazing at the seated figure, whose gown
looked rusty behind the polished lynx-black
pressed against it. There was no mistaking the
truth in the pale, wretched eyes.</p>

<p>"Disappointed about the money, though,
and taking out her ill temper on me," thought
the visitor.</p>

<p>To Eliza's increased heaviness of heart, the
lady resumed her seat.</p>

<p>"Aunt Mary's death was sudden and unexpected
and that explains her not speaking of
me," she said; "but I know it would please
her that I should use something that she had
owned. I remember that shawl as being a very
good one. It came to her from some of
her husband's people. I'll buy that of you,
Eliza."</p>

<p>"Will you?" returned the other, and Pluto
emitted an indignant yowl and tried to leap
from the tightening hold.</p>

<p>"Don't you let him go, Eliza!" cried Mrs.
Fabian in a panic. "He's crazy about my fur.
They always are.&mdash;Yes, the shawl is of no use
to you and the money will be. It is so fine, it
would be wicked to cut it into a wrap. I shall
spread it on my grand piano."</p>

<p>Silence, while Eliza struggled still to control<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the trembling lips, and Pluto twisted to escape
her imprisoning arm.</p>

<p>"I'm willing to give you twenty-five dollars
for that shawl."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian waited, and presently Eliza
spoke:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It ain't enough," she said, against her
impeding breath.</p>

<p>"Fifty, then. We all feel grateful to you."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Fabian," Eliza sat up in her chair as if
galvanized and looked her visitor in the eyes,
while she spoke with unsteady solemnity, "the
price o' that shawl is one million dollars."</p>

<p>The visitor stared at the shabby figure with
the grey, unkempt locks, then shrugged her
shoulders with a smile. "You'll come to your
senses, Eliza," she said. "Some day that fifty
dollars will look very good to you. I'll hold the
offer open&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Likewise," added Eliza, breaking in upon
her words with heightened voice, but the same
deliberation, "that is the price of each handkerchief
she left me, and each one of her little,
wornout slippers, and her&mdash;"</p>

<p>She could get no further. She choked. Mrs. Fabian
rose; Pluto, with another cry and a supreme
writhe, tore himself from his iron prison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>The visitor shuddered, and looked at him
fearfully, as his eager eyes seemed to threaten
her. She hastened precipitately toward the
door.</p>

<p>Eliza, putting the utmost constraint upon
herself, rose and ushered her out.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian uttered a brief good-bye. Eliza
was beyond speech.</p>

<p>While the visitor entered her waiting car,
and sank with relief among its cushions, the
mourner stood, her back against the closed
door, and her eyes closed.</p>

<p>Restrained drops ran down her cheeks in
well-worn ruts, and occasionally a spasmodic
sob shook the slight form.</p>

<p>Pluto came to her feet, his short tail stiffly
outstretched and his half-closed eyes lifted to
the sightless face. In the long silence he rubbed
himself against her feet in token of forgiveness.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">PHILIP SIDNEY</p>


<p>The Fabians had given Philip Sidney a pressing
invitation to spend his first week in New York
with them. When he arrived, however, and
announced himself at the house, through some
misunderstanding there was no one there to
receive him save the servants.</p>

<p>A comely maid apologized for the absence of
her mistress, saying that Mr. Sidney had not
been expected until the following day; and
showing him to his room she left him to his own
devices.</p>

<p>Emerging from his bath and toilet, he found
Mrs. Fabian not yet returned. It was but
four o'clock, and he decided to go to the
Ballard apartment and attend to his errand
there.</p>

<p>Eliza had been doing some sweeping, the
need for it goading her New England conscience
to action. Her brown calico dress was pinned
up over her petticoat, and her stern, lined face
looked out from a sweeping-cap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>There sounded suddenly a vigorous knock on
her door.</p>

<p>She scowled. "Some fresh agent, I s'pose,"
she thought. "Too sly to speak up the tube."</p>

<p>Broom in hand, she strode to the door and
pulled it open with swift indignation.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you ring?" she exclaimed
fiercely. "We don't want&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused, her mouth open, and stared at
the young man who pulled off a soft felt hat,
and looked reassuring and breezy as he smiled.</p>

<p>"I did ring, but it was the wrong apartment.
There was no card downstairs, so I started up
the trail. Is this Mrs. Ballard's?"</p>

<p>The frank face, which she instantly recognized,
and the clear voice that had a non-citified
deliberation, accused Eliza of lack of
hospitality; and she suddenly grew intensely
conscious of her cap and petticoat.</p>

<p>"Come in," she said. "I was doin' some
sweepin'. The first&mdash;" she paused abruptly
and led the way down the corridor to the
shabby living-room.</p>

<p>Phil's long steps followed her while his eyes
shone with appreciation of the drum-major
effect of the cap and broom, and the memory of
his fierce greeting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't wonder Aunt Mary died," he
thought. "I would too."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Eliza's heart was thumping. This
interview was the climax of all she had dreaded.
The usurper had an even more manly and attractive
exterior than she had expected, but
well she knew the brutal indifference of youth;
the selfishness that takes all things for granted,
and that secretly despises the treasures of the
old.</p>

<p>The haste with which she set the broom in
the corner, unpinned her dress, and pulled off
her cap, was tribute to the virile masculinity
of the visitor; but the stony expression of her
face was defence from the blows which she
felt he would deliver with the same airy unconsciousness
that showed in the swing of his
walk.</p>

<p>"You're Eliza Brewster, I'm sure," he said.
"My mother knew you when she was a girl."</p>

<p>The hasty removal of Eliza's cap had caused
a weird flying-out of her locks. The direct gaze
bent upon her twinkled.</p>

<p>"I wonder if she'd let me paint her as
Medusa," he was thinking; while her unspoken
comment was: "And she never saw his
teeth! It's just as well."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, that's who I am," she said. "Sit down,
Mr. Sidney. I've been expectin' you."</p>

<p>"You didn't behave that way," he replied
good-naturedly, obeying. "I thought at first I
was going downstairs quicker than I came up,
and I'd taken them three at a time."</p>

<p>His manner was disarming and Eliza
smoothed her flying locks.</p>

<p>"The agents try to sneak around the rules o'
the house," she said briefly.</p>

<p>"So this is where Aunt Mary lived." He
looked about the room with interest. "We
people in God's country hear about these flats
where you don't dare keep a dog for fear it'll
wag its tail and knock something over."</p>

<p>The troublesome lump in Eliza's throat had
to be swallowed, so the visitor's keen glance
swept about the bare place in silence.</p>

<p>"I see she didn't go in much for jim-cracks,"
he added presently.</p>

<p>Eliza's lump was swallowed. "Mrs. Ballard
didn't care for common things," she said
coldly. "She was an artist."</p>

<p>Phil comprehended vaguely that rebuke was
implied, and he met the hard gaze as he hastened
to reply:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I understand." An increase of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
pathos he had always discerned since learning
about his great-aunt, swept over him now, face
to face with the meagreness of her surroundings.
"Did Aunt Mary work in this room? I see an
easel over there."</p>

<p>"Yes, she worked here." The reply came in
an expressionless voice.</p>

<p>"Poor Aunt Mary!" thought the visitor.
"No companion but this image!"</p>

<p>Eliza exerted heroic self-control as she continued:
"I've got the things packed up for you&mdash;the
paints, and brushes, and palette. The
easel's yours, too. Do you want to take 'em
to-day?"</p>

<p>"Would it be a convenience to you if I did?
Are you going to give up the flat immediately?"</p>

<p>"In a week."</p>

<p>"Then I'll leave them a few days if you don't
mind while I'm looking for a room. I haven't
an idea where to go. I'm more lost here than I
ever was in the woods; but the Fabians will
advise me, perhaps. Mrs. Fabian has been here
to see you, I suppose."</p>

<p>Eliza's thin lips parted in a monosyllable of
assent.</p>

<p>"What a wooden Indian!" thought Phil.
Nevertheless, being a genial soul and having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
heard Miss Brewster's faithfulness extolled, he
talked on: "We hear about New York streets
being canyons. They are that, and the sky-line
is amazing; but the noise,&mdash;great heavens,
what a racket! and I can't seem to get a
breath."</p>

<p>The young fellow rose restlessly, throwing
back his shoulders, and paced the little room,
filling it with his mountain stride.</p>

<p>Eliza Brewster watched him. She thought of
her mistress, and the pride and joy it would
have been to her to receive this six feet of manhood
under her roof.</p>

<p>"She wouldn't 'a' kept her sentimental
dreams long," reflected Eliza bitterly. "He'd
'a' hurt her, he'd 'a' stepped on her feelin's and
never known it. He walks as if he had spurs on
his boots." She steeled herself against considering
him through Mrs. Ballard's eyes. "He's
better-lookin' than the picture," she thought,
"and I wouldn't trust a handsome man as far
as I could see him. They haven't any business
with beauty and it always upsets 'em one way
or another&mdash;yes, every time."</p>

<p>Her eyes wandered to the mantelpiece whose
bareness was relieved only by three varying
sized pieces of blank paper. She felt the slight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>est
quiver of remorse as she looked. She seemed
to see her mistress's gentle glance filled with
rebuke.</p>

<p>She stirred in her chair, folded her arms, and
cleared her throat.</p>

<p>"You can leave the things here till I go, if
you want to," she said.</p>

<p>Phil paused in his promenade and regarded
her. Her manner was so unmistakably inimical
that for the first time he wondered.</p>

<p>Perhaps, after all, she was not just a machine.
And the same thought which had been entertained
by Mrs. Fabian occurred to him.</p>

<p>"Twenty-five years of faithful service," he
reflected. "I wonder if she expected the money?
She's sore at me. That's a cinch."</p>

<p>Phil's artist nature grasped her standpoint in
a flash. The granite face, with its signs of suffering,
the loneliness, the poverty, all appealed to
him to excuse her disappointment.</p>

<p>His eyes swept about the bare walls.</p>

<p>"Where are Aunt Mary's pictures?" he
asked. "Was she too modest to hang them?"</p>

<p>"There were some up there," replied Eliza.
"I took 'em down."</p>

<p>The visitor's quick eyes noted the white
boards on the mantelpiece. With an unex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>pected
movement, he strode across to it, and
turned them around.</p>

<p>He stood in the same position for a space.</p>

<p>"Great guns, but she hates me!" he thought,
while Eliza, startled, felt the shamed color
stream up to her temples.</p>

<p>"What would Mrs. Ballard say!" was her
guilty reflection.</p>

<p>Pluto here relieved the situation by making a
majestic entrance. His jewel eyes fixed on the
stranger for a moment with blinking indifference,
then he proceeded, with measured tread,
toward the haven of his mistress's lap.</p>

<p>"Hello, Katze," said Phil, stooping his scarlet
face. He seized the creature by the nape of
its neck and instantly the amazed cat was
swung up to his broad shoulder, where it sat,
claws digging into his coat and eyes glowering
into his own.</p>

<p>"Say, charcoal would make a white mark on
you, pussy," he went on, smoothing the creature
in a manner which evidently found favor,
for Pluto did not offer to stir.</p>

<p>"When I'm not doing her as Medusa," he
reflected, "I'll paint her as a witch with this
familiar. She'll only have to look at the artist
to get the right expression."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"A distinguished visitor from the island of
Manx, I suspect," he said aloud.</p>

<p>"No," returned Eliza, still fearfully embarrassed.
"Pluto was born right here in New
York."</p>

<p>The ever-ready stars in the visitor's eyes
twinkled again into the green fire opposite them.</p>

<p>"It was his tail I was noticing. Manx cats
are like that."</p>

<p>"Oh, that was boys. If I could 'a' caught
'em I'd 'a' liked to cut off their arms."</p>

<p>"I'll bet on that," thought Phil, "and their
legs too."</p>

<p>Eliza cleared her throat. She seemed still to
see the gentle eyes of her lost one rebuking her.
With utter disregard of a future state she was
preparing a lie.</p>

<p>"About those sketches," she said presently,
and such was her hoarseness that she was
obliged to clear her throat again, "you see,
I was&mdash;sweepin', and I turned 'em to the
wall."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Phil, and continued to
smooth Pluto who purred lustily. "A pretty
good one for New England," he thought; and
carelessly turning the third card about, he came
face to face with his own photograph.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>With one glance of disgust he tore the picture
in two and threw it down.</p>

<p>Eliza started. "What did you do that for?"
she demanded sharply.</p>

<p>Phil made a motion of impatience.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's so darned pretty!" he explained.
"I thought all those pictures were in the fire."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Ballard set great store by that," said
Eliza coldly, "and by the sketches, too," she
added.</p>

<p>She was sitting up stiffly in her chair, now,
and her gaze fixed on Phil, as, her cat on his
shoulder singing loud praise of his fondling
hand, he came and stood before her.</p>

<p>"I wish you'd let me see some of Aunt
Mary's pictures," he said.</p>

<p>The dead woman's letter was against his
heart. He felt that they were standing together,
opposed to the hard, grudging face
confronting him.</p>

<p>But this was Eliza's crucial moment. In spite
of herself she feared in the depths of her heart
that that which Mrs. Ballard had said was true;
that this restless, careless boy had an artistic
ability which her dear one had never attained.
She shrank with actual nausea from his comments
on her mistress's work. He might not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
say anything unkind, but she should see the
lines of his mouth, the quiver of an eyelash.</p>

<p>She felt unable to rise.</p>

<p>"She left 'em all to me," she said mechanically,
pale eyes meeting dark ones.</p>

<p>Phil brushed Pluto's ears and the cat sang
through the indignity.</p>

<p>"Talk about the bark on a tree!" he
thought. "I believe I'll paint her as a miser,
after all! She'd be a wonder, with Pluto standing
guard, green eyes peering out of the
shadow."</p>

<p>He smiled down at Eliza, the curves of his
lips stretching over the teeth she had admired.</p>

<p>"All right," he said. "I'm not going to take
them away from you."</p>

<p>Eliza forced herself to her feet, and without
another word slowly left the room.</p>

<p>Phil met the cat's blinking eyes where the
pupils were dilating and contracting. "Katze,
this place gives me the horrors!" he confided.</p>

<p>More than once on the train he had read over
his aunt's letter, and each time her words smote
an answering chord in his heart and set it to
aching.</p>

<p>The present visit accentuated the perception
of what her life had been. For a moment his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
eyes glistened wet against the cat's indolent
contentment.</p>

<p>"I wish she hadn't saved any money, the
poor little thing," he muttered. "No friends, no
sympathy&mdash;nothing but that avaricious piece
of humanity, calculating every day, probably,
on how soon she would get it all. I'll paint her
as a harpy. That's what I'll do. Talons of
steel! That's all she needs." He heard a sound
and dashed a hand across his eyes.</p>

<p>Eliza, heavy of heart, stony of face, entered,
a number of pictures bound together, in her
hands. The visitor darted forward to relieve
her, and Pluto drove claws into his suddenly
unsteady resting-place.</p>

<p>Eliza yielded up her treasures like victims,
and stood motionless while Phil received them.
Never had she looked so gaunt and grey and
old; but the visitor did not give her a glance.
Aunt Mary's letter was beating against his
heart. Here was the work her longing hands
had wrought, here the thwarting of her hopes.</p>

<p>His fingers were not quite steady as he untied
the strings, and moving the easel into a good
light placed a canvas upon it.</p>

<p>Eliza did not wish to look at him, but she
could not help it. Her pale gaze fixed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
his face in a torture of expectation, as he
backed away from the easel, his eyes on the
picture.</p>

<p>Pluto rubbed against his ear as a hint that
caressing be renewed.</p>

<p>He stood in silence, and Eliza could detect
nothing like a smile on his face.</p>

<p>Presently he removed the canvas, and took
up another. It was the portrait of Pluto.</p>

<p>"Hello, Katze. Got your picture took, did
you? Aunt Mary saw your green shadows all
right."</p>

<p>He set the canvas aside, and took up another.
Eliza's muscles ached with tension. Her bony
hands clasped as she recognized the picture.
To the kittens over the table in the kitchen she
had once confided that this landscape, which
the artist had called "Autumn," looked to her
eyes like nothing on earth but a prairie fire!
It had been a terrible moment of heresy. She
was punished for it now.</p>

<p>Phil backed away from the canvas, and elbow
in his hand, rested his finger on his lips for
what seemed to Eliza an age. Her heart
thumped, but she could not remove her gaze
from him.</p>

<p>Pluto, finding squirming and rubbing of no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
avail, leaped to the floor and blinked reflectively
at his mistress. A flagpole would have
offered equal facilities for cuddling.</p>

<p>He therefore made deliberate selection of the
least unsatisfactory chair, and with noiseless
grace took possession.</p>

<p>Phil nodded. "Yes, sir," he murmured; "yes,
sir."</p>

<p>Eliza's teeth bit tighter on her suffering under
lip. What did "Yes, sir" mean? At least he
was not smiling.</p>

<p>He went on, slightly nodding, and thinking
aloud; "Aunt Mary was ahead of her time. She
knew what she was after."</p>

<p>Eliza tried to speak, and couldn't. Something
clicked in her throat.</p>

<p>Phil went on regarding the autumnal tangle,
and with a superhuman effort Eliza commanded
her tongue.</p>

<p>"What was that you said, Mr. Sidney?"</p>

<p>Phil, again becoming conscious of the stony
presence, smiled a little.</p>

<p>"Aunt Mary would have found sympathizers
in Munich," he said.</p>

<p>"That's Germany, ain't it?" said Eliza,
words and breath interlocking.</p>

<p>"Yes. Most of Uncle Sam's relatives want to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
see plainer what's doing; at least those who are
able to buy pictures."</p>

<p>"Ahead of her time!" gasped Eliza, her blood
racing through her veins. "Ought to 'a' been
in Germany!"</p>

<p>And then the most amazing occurrence of
Philip Sidney's life took place. There was a
rush toward him, and suddenly his Medusa,
his witch, his miser, his harpy was on her knees
on the floor beside him, covering his hand with
tears and kisses, and pouring out a torrent of
words.</p>

<p>"I've nearly died with dread of you, Mr.
Sidney. Oh, why isn't she here to hear you say
those words of her pictures! Nobody was ever
kind to her. Her relations paid no more attention
to her, or her work, than if she'd been a&mdash;a&mdash;I
don't know what. She was poor, and too
modest, and the best and sweetest creature on
earth; and when your sketches came she admired
'em so that I began to hate you then.
Yes, Mr. Sidney, you was a relative, and goin'
to be a success, and the look in her eyes when
she saw your work killed me. It killed me!"</p>

<p>"Do, do get up," said Philip, trying to raise
her. "Don't weep so, Eliza. I understand."</p>

<p>But the torrent could not yet be stemmed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've looked forward to your comin' like to
an operation. I've thought you might laugh at
her pictures, 'cause young folks are so cruel,
and they don't know! Let me cry, Mr. Sidney.
Don't mind! You've given me the first happy
moment I've known since she left me. I was the
only one she had, even to go to picture galleries
with her, and my bones ached 'cause I was a
stupid thing, and she had wings just like a little
spirit o' light."</p>

<p>Philip's lashes were moist again.</p>

<p>"I wish I had been here to go with her," he
said.</p>

<p>Eliza lifted her streaming eyes. "Would you
'a' gone?" she asked, and allowed Phil to raise
her gently to her feet.</p>

<p>"Indeed, I would," he answered gravely,
"and we should have lived together, and
worked together."</p>

<p>"Oh, why couldn't it 'a' been! Why
couldn't it 'a' been! What it would 'a' meant
to her to have heard what you said just now
about her pictures!"</p>

<p>Phil's hands were holding Eliza's thin shoulders,
and her famished eyes were drinking in the
comfort of him.</p>

<p>"I have an idea that we ought not to believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
that we could make her happier than she is," he
said, with the same gravity.</p>

<p>"I know," faltered Eliza, surprised; "of
course that's the way I ought to feel; but there
wasn't ever anything she cared much about
except paintin'. She"&mdash;Eliza swallowed the
tremulous sob that was the aftermath of the
storm&mdash;"she loved music, but she wasn't a
performer."</p>

<p>Phil smiled into the appealing face.</p>

<p>"Then she's painting, for all we know," he
said. "Do you believe music is all that goes on
there?"</p>

<p>"It's all that's mentioned," said Eliza
apologetically.</p>

<p>"I have an idea that dying doesn't change
us any," said the young man. "Why should
it?"</p>

<p>"It didn't need to change her," agreed the
other, her voice breaking.</p>

<p>"I believe that in the end we get what we
want."</p>

<p>"That's comfortin'."</p>

<p>"Not so you'd notice it," returned Phil with
conviction. "It makes the chills run down my
spine occasionally when I stop to realize it."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>"Only that we had better examine what
we're wanting; and choose something that
won't go back on us. Aunt Mary did; and I
believe she had a strong faith."</p>

<p>"We never talked religion," said Eliza.</p>

<p>"Just lived it. That's better."</p>

<p>"I didn't," returned Eliza, a spark of the old
belligerency flashing in her faded eyes. "I can't
think of one single enemy that I love!"</p>

<p>"You were everything to Aunt Mary. Do
you suppose I shall ever forget that?"</p>

<p>"I sat down in front o' those pictures in the
Metropolitan Museum," said Eliza, her lips
trembling again. "It's awful big, and I got so
tuckered, the pictures sort o' ran together till
I didn't know a landscape from a portrait.
Then I used to take on over somethin' that had
a seat in front of it, and she'd leave me sittin'
there starin'. Oh, Mr. Sidney, I can't think o'
one other mean thing I ever did to her,"&mdash;remorseful
grief shook the speaker's voice,&mdash;"but
I'd ought to 'a' stood up to the end. It
would 'a' showed more interest!"</p>

<p>Phil squeezed the spare shoulders as they
heaved. He laughed a little.</p>

<p>"Now, Eliza, whatever way you managed it,
I know you made her happy."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," groaned the repentant one, "she said
my artistic soul was wakin' up. Do you s'pose
where she is now she knows it was black
deceit?"</p>

<p>"She knows nothing black where she is,"&mdash;Phil's
voice rang with decision; "but she does
know more than ever about love and sacrifice
such as you have shown her. Beside," in a
lighter tone, "how about your artistic soul? See
how far above everybody else you understood
her pictures."</p>

<p>Eliza's hungry gaze became suddenly inscrutable.
"Mr. Sidney," she began, after a
pause, "I loved every stroke her dear hand
made, but"&mdash;again pain crept into the breaking
voice&mdash;"you said yourself America wasn't
worthy of her, and I'm only what you might
call the scum of America when it comes to
<em>insight</em> and&mdash;and <em>expression</em> and&mdash;and <em>atmosphere</em>.
Usually I had sense enough to wait
till she told me what a thing was before I talked
about it; but one day, I can't ever forget it, I
praised a flock o' sheep at the back of a field
she was doin' and she said they was&mdash;was
cows!"</p>

<p>Sobs rent the speaker and she covered her
eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>"I told her&mdash;'twas my glasses," she went
on when she could speak. "I&mdash;told her they&mdash;hadn't
been right for&mdash;a long time. She
laughed&mdash;and tried to make a joke of it,
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>Eliza's voice was drowned in the flood.</p>

<p>Phil patted her shoulders and smiled across
the bowed head at the forlorn mantelpiece,
where the sketches, unconscious of forgiveness,
still turned faces toward the wall.</p>

<p>"You've grown awfully morbid, alone here,"
he said, giving her a little shake. "You should
be only thankful, as I am, that Aunt Mary had
you and that you were here to take care of her
to the end. Come and sit down. She wrote me a
wonderful letter. I have it in my pocket and
I'll show it to you."</p>

<p>Eliza obediently yielded herself to be guided
to a chair. Pluto had selected the best with unerring
instinct; and suddenly into his feline
dreams an earthquake intruded as Phil tossed
him lightly to the floor.</p>

<p>Drawing his chair close to Eliza, who had
wilted back against the faded cretonne roses,
the young man drew from his pocket an envelope
and took out of it a letter, and a small card
photograph.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mother gave me this old picture of Aunt
Mary&mdash;"</p>

<p>Eliza pulled herself up and took it eagerly.
"I must get my glasses," she said. "I've cried
myself nearly blind."</p>

<p>Phil's big hand pushed her back.</p>

<p>"I'll get them," he returned. "Where are
they?"</p>

<p>"There, on the end o' the mantelpiece. I had
'em, readin' an advertisement."</p>

<p>She leaned back again and watched him as he
crossed the room; watched him with wonder.
In years she had not so given her confidence to a
human being.</p>

<p>She put on the spectacles and wistfully regarded
the picture of a pretty woman whose
heavy braids, wound around her head, caught
the light. Her plain dress was white and she
wore black velvet bands on her wrists.</p>

<p>"Aunt Mary was considered different by her
friends, mother says. In a time of frills she
liked plain things."</p>

<p>"I guess she <em>was</em> different," agreed Eliza
devoutly. "Would you think a man who married
her would like whiskey better?"</p>

<p>Phil shook his head. "Sorry," he said,
laconically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"One good thing, he drank himself to death
quick and left her free."</p>

<p>Phil held out the letter.</p>

<p>"Read it to me, please, Mr. Sidney."</p>

<p>"Can't do it," returned the young man with
cheerful frankness. "It makes my nose tingle
every time."</p>

<p>So Eliza read the letter in silence. It took her
some minutes and when she had finished, her lip
caught between her teeth, she took off her
glasses and wiped them while she regarded Phil.</p>

<p>"And you've got to live up to that," she
said.</p>

<p>"I'm going to try," he answered simply.</p>

<p>Eliza gazed at him, her hands in her lap. She
felt old beside his youth, weak beside his
strength, ignorant beside that knowledge which
had stirred her mistress to exaltation. Nevertheless,
the humble love, and desire to help him
that swelled her heart was a new desire to live, a
consecration.</p>

<p>Presently he took his leave, promising to
return in a few days for his belongings.</p>

<p>After the door had closed behind him, she
looked down at the cat, who had awakened
from another nap at the stir of the departure.</p>

<p>He rubbed against her brown calico skirt as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
she lighted the gas; then she moved thoughtfully
to the mantelpiece and turned the
sketches about.</p>

<p>"Mary Sidney," she mused, looking at the
graceful head of Phil's mother, "you've had
your heartache, and your sacrifices. You've
been most pulled in two, between longin' to
stay with your husband and follow your son&mdash;you
told me somethin' of it in your note
thankin' for the brooch. Nobody escapes,
Mary Sidney. I guess I haven't done you
justice, seein' you've raised a boy like that."</p>

<p>Turning to the sketch of the storm-beaten
tree, she clasped her hands before it. "Dear
one," she mused tenderly, "you loved him.
You was great. You died not knowin' how
great you were; and you won't care if I do
understand this kind better, 'cause all America's
too ignorant for you, and I'm one o' the worst."</p>

<p>Her eyes dwelt lingeringly on the sketch. She
fancied she could hear the wind whistling
through the writhing branches. "It looks like
my life," she thought, "risin' out o' the mist
and the cloud."</p>

<p>She gazed at it in silence, then turned to the
destroyed photograph. She seized the pieces
quickly and turned them face up. The rent had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
missed the chin and cut across the collar. She
regarded the face wistfully. The cat stretched
his forepaws up her skirt until he was of a preternatural
length. It was supper-time.</p>

<p>"I wonder, Pluto," she said slowly, "if I
couldn't fit that into a minicher frame. Some
of 'em come real reasonable."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">ELIZA'S INVITATION</p>


<p>For the first time since she had been left alone,
Eliza drank her tea that night without tears;
and no lump in her throat prevented her
swallowing the egg she had boiled.</p>

<p>She held Mrs. Ballard's watch in her hand a
minute before getting into bed; and looked long
at its gold face, and listened to its loud and busy
ticking.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Mrs. Ballard," she thought;
and association added, "as we forgive our
debtors!"</p>

<p>"No, I can't!" she muttered fiercely. "I
can't! What's the use o' pretendin'!"</p>

<p>Muffling the watch in its slipper, she turned
out the gas and got into bed. Composing herself
to sleep more peacefully than she had been
able to do for many a night, her last thought
was of Mrs. Ballard's heir; and a sense of comfort
stole over her in the very fact of his existence.
Again she seemed to feel the sympathetic
pressure of his kind hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"He thinks she may be paintin' still," she
reflected. "She's got colors to work with that's
most blindin', they're so gorgeous, if we can
judge anything by the sunsets at the island.
Why not think so! It's just as reasonable as
playin' harps, for all I can see."</p>

<p>Ever since her dear one's passing, Eliza had
felt too crushed and too wicked to pray; and
being unable to say the whole of her Lord's
Prayer, her New England conscience would not
allow her to say any of it; but to-night a sense
of hope and gratitude lightened the darkness,
and a new gentleness crept over her countenance
as it relaxed its lines in slumber.</p>

<p>She wakened next morning without the load
of despair on her heart; and slowly realized
what had changed her outlook. She even
smiled at the cat, who had leaped up on the foot
of her bed. He understood that he might come
no nearer.</p>

<p>"Every single mornin', Pluto, I've been
dreadin' that the day had come I'd got to show
her pictures to him. Well, that's over."</p>

<p>"Meow!" remarked Pluto, commenting on
the selfishness of beings who overslept.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know what you want." Eliza turned
her head wearily on the pillow. "'Weak as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
cat'! I don't think much o' that expression. I
notice you're strong enough to get everything
you want. Oh, dear, I wonder if I'll ever feel
like myself again!"</p>

<p>The cat jumped to the floor, and coming to
the head of the bed sat down and regarded the
haggard face reproachfully.</p>

<p>"You're just as handsome as a picture,
Pluto," mused Eliza aloud. "I don't know
as it's ever made you any worse 'n common
cats."</p>

<p>This optimistic change of heart lightened the
atmosphere of the cheerless kitchen that morning;
and Eliza drew up the shade, which let the
sun slant in past a neighboring roof for a short
half-hour.</p>

<p>A beam struck the kittens frisking above the
kitchen table, and they seemed to spring from
the shadowy gloom of their corner, flinging their
little paws about with the infantine glee which
had first captivated their owner.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you can dance, still," she murmured,
addressing them reproachfully; but she
left the shade up.</p>

<p>It was nearly noon when her doorbell rang
again. Eliza hastened to the glass. She had on
her black alpaca to-day. Sweeping-cap and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
apron were remanded to their corner, and she
made certain that her hair was smooth, then
went to the speaking-tube.</p>

<p>"Yes?" she said, and listened for the possible
voice of yesterday; but a woman's tones put the
question:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is this Mrs. Ballard's apartment?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Eliza briefly.</p>

<p>"Is this Eliza Brewster?" again asked the
sweet voice.</p>

<p>"It is," came the non-committal admission.</p>

<p>"May I come up, Eliza? It's Mrs. Wright."</p>

<p>"Mrs. who?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Wright. Don't you remember my
spending the day with Mrs. Ballard last spring,
just before I went to Brewster's Island?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Wright!" exclaimed Eliza in a
different tone. "Excuse me for keepin' you
waitin'. Come right up."</p>

<p>Well Eliza recalled the enjoyment of her dear
one in that visit of an old friend, rarely seen.
Mrs. Ballard's social pleasures were so few, this
day gleamed as a bright spot in memory; and,
not content with opening wide the door, Eliza
went out to the head of the stairs to receive the
mounting figure.</p>

<p>"<em>She</em> stood here the last time," she said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
brokenly, as the visitor reached her and held
out both hands to receive Eliza's.</p>

<p>The newcomer's silver-white hair made an
aureole about the face that looked with kindly
eyes into the other's dim ones.</p>

<p>"I was just thinking of that as I saw you
waiting," she said. "It was a shock to me to
learn that Mrs. Ballard had left us. Was it very
sudden, Eliza?"</p>

<p>The latter could not trust herself to speak.
She nodded and ushered Mrs. Wright into the
living-room, where they both sat down, the
visitor's heart touched by the mourner's altered
countenance, and the evident struggle she was
making not to give way. Her compassion
showed in her gentle face and Eliza made a brave
effort to smile.</p>

<p>"I know I'm a sight, Mrs. Wright," she faltered.
"I've never been any hand to cry, but
I've nearly washed the eyes out o' my head the
past week. I don't expect anybody to know what
I've lost." Her lips twitched and she bit them
hard.</p>

<p>"I can very well imagine," returned the
other, "for Mrs. Ballard spoke so warmly
of you to me, and told me how many
years your fortunes had been cast together.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
She said you were the mainspring of the
house."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mrs. Wright," said Eliza humbly.
"Yes, I saw that she ate and slept right.
Her interests were where I couldn't follow
'cause I didn't know enough; but she was the
mainspring o' my life. It's broken, broken. I
haven't got the energy to lift a finger, nor a
thing to live for. Honestly, Mrs. Wright,"
added Eliza in a burst of despair, "if 't wa'n't
for the commonness of a Brewster bein' found
so disrespectable as dead in a New York flat,
and strange folks layin' their hands on me, I
wouldn't 'a' lived through some o' the nights
I've had since she went away. I'd lay there
and try to think o' one single person it'd
make any difference to, and there ain't one."</p>

<p>"My dear," returned Mrs. Wright, regarding
the haggard face, "how about your relatives on
the island?"</p>

<p>Eliza shook her head. "The only folks o'
mine that are left are '-in-laws,' or else cousins
I've scarcely heard from for twenty-five years.
They haven't troubled themselves about me,
and if I'd 'a' walked out that way, they'd
only 'a' said I'd ought to be ashamed o' myself."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"And so you ought," said Mrs. Wright with
her gentle smile.</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't anyway," said Eliza wearily.
"Did you stay at the island all summer?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I'm still there. May I take off my
coat, Eliza?"</p>

<p>The hostess started up with sudden recollection.</p>

<p>"I hope you'll excuse me, Mrs. Wright; if I
ever had any manners they're gone."</p>

<p>Slipping off the coat, and relinquishing it into
Eliza's hands, the visitor went on talking. "My
husband gave up business a couple of years ago.
Perhaps Mrs. Ballard has told you that he was
never a successful business man." Mrs. Wright
stifled a sigh under a bright smile. "Nobody
can be well and idle long, you know, so the next
thing he began to be ailing, the dear man, and
he thought the sea would do him good; and, my
dear Eliza, it has done him so much good that
we have become islanders."</p>

<p>"You don't mean you're going to stay
there?"</p>

<p>The visitor nodded the silvery aureole of her
hair.</p>

<p>"That is what I mean. Mr. Wright went
fishing all summer and he thinks he has found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
his niche in life. He has not been so well and
happy in years."</p>

<p>"You'll stay all winter?" asked Eliza
incredulously.</p>

<p>"Yes," the visitor smiled again, "and all the
winters, so far as I know. Mr. Wright is perfectly
content."</p>

<p>"How about you?" asked Eliza briefly. She
had gone back to her chair and frowned unconsciously
into the peaceful face regarding her.</p>

<p>"Oh!" Mrs. Wright raised her eyebrows and
gave her head a slight shake. "'In my father's
house are many mansions!' I like to feel that it
is all His house, even now, and that wherever
I may live He is there, so why should I be
lonely?"</p>

<p>Listening to these words, it seemed to Eliza
as if some lamp, kept burning on the altar of
this woman's soul, sent its steady light into the
peaceful eyes regarding her.</p>

<p>"It's a good thing you can get comfort that
way," she responded, rather awkwardly. "I
know it must 'a' been a struggle to consent to it&mdash;any
one used to a big city like Boston. What
does your niece say to it?"</p>

<p>"Violet was with me a while. I am visiting
her here now."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>"She teaches, don't she?&mdash;the languages, or
something?" inquired Eliza vaguely.</p>

<p>"No, gymnastic dancing and other branches
of physical culture. She works hard, and no
place ever rested her like the island, she
thought. Do you remember Jane Foster?"</p>

<p>The corners of Eliza's mouth drew down in a
smiling grimace of recollection.</p>

<p>"Do I remember Jennie Foster!" she said.
"We grew up together."</p>

<p>"Well, she keeps a boarding-house in Portland
now in winters and comes to the old
home, summers. We boarded with her, and
now, instead of closing up the place, she has
rented it to me."</p>

<p>Eliza shook her head. "Pretty high up," she
commented. "Some o' those February gales
will pretty near shave you off the hill."</p>

<p>"A good many husky generations have been
brought up and gone forth into the world out
of that house," said Mrs. Wright cheerfully.
"There are some trees, you know. Do you
remember the apple orchard?"</p>

<p>"Huh!" commented Eliza. "I know how the
scrawny little things look when they're bare!
A lot o' shelter they'll be."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wright dropped her head a little to one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
side and her kind grey eyes rested on Eliza's
grief-scarred face. "I'm glad I came to see
you," she said irrelevantly.</p>

<p>"I'm a kind of a Job's comforter, I'm afraid.
When I've thought of anything the past fortnight
I've thought about Brewster's Island,&mdash;a
sort of a counter-irritant, I guess."</p>

<p>"No, no, we can't have that. You mustn't
call the Blessed Isle by such a name."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it won't be such a Blessed Isle
after you've spent a winter there," remarked
Eliza drily.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wright smiled. "I know it was your
native place, and I hoped you might have
pleasant associations with it."</p>

<p>Eliza sighed wearily. "Yes, if I could be
twelve years old again, and go coastin' and
skatin', and when it was dark tumble into bed
under the eaves with a hot bag o' sand to keep
the sheets from freezin' me, I should like it, I
s'pose. I used to; but nobody on that snow-covered
hill cares whether I'm alive or dead,
and that cruel black ocean that swallowed up
my father one night, and killed my mother,
<em>that</em> roarin' around the island in the freezin' gale
is the only thing I can see and hear when I
think of the winter."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then you have been thinking of going back
to the island?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's either that or goin' into somebody's
kitchen, here." Eliza's mouth twitched
grimly. "Mrs. Fabian offered me a recommendation."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. The Fabians were very kind to
Violet this summer."</p>

<p>"You don't say so! I'm glad they can be
kind to somebody."</p>

<p>The bitterness of Eliza's tone impressed her
visitor. "Mrs. Ballard was Mrs. Fabian's aunt,
I believe," she ventured.</p>

<p>"I believe so, too," said Eliza, "but nothing
she ever did proved it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wright veered away from dangerous
ground. "I have been thinking of you a great
deal since I learned of Mrs. Ballard's going,
and I wanted at least to see you before I went
back." There was a little pause, then she
added: "It occurred to me that you might be
going home to the island&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I haven't any home there," interrupted
Eliza stoically.</p>

<p>"&mdash;and I was going to ask you, in that case,
if you wouldn't eat your Thanksgiving dinner
with me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Eliza looked at her visitor, startled.</p>

<p>"Think of me," she said slowly, "eatin' a
Thanksgivin' dinner&mdash;anywhere."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wright felt a pang at her heart under
the desolation of the voice. It seemed the voice
of the forlorn room in which they sat. She rose
to hide the look in her eyes, and moving to the
mantel took up the sketches that stood there.</p>

<p>"Are these interesting things Mrs. Ballard's
work?" she asked.</p>

<p>Eliza was clutching the meagre arms of her
chair until her knuckles whitened. How fate
was softening toward her! The thought that
this friend of her lost one would have her own
hearth on the dreaded island warmed the winter
prospect. A link with Mrs. Ballard. A friend
with whom she might talk of her. The rift made
yesterday in her submerging clouds widened.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Wright," she said, unheeding the
visitor's question, "you're religious, I know,
'cause you quoted the Bible, and 'cause you
take cheerfully bein' buried in a snowdrift on
Brewster's Island instead of havin' the things
you're accustomed to. So I want you to know
before you invite me to have Thanksgivin'
dinner with you that I'm the wickedest woman
in New York. I haven't said a prayer since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Mrs. Ballard died. I hate Mrs. Fabian for her
neglect of her, and I did hate the young man
Mrs. Ballard left her little bit o' money to."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wright, holding the sketch of Mary
Sidney, turned and looked at the speaker.</p>

<p>"Hated him 'cause he was an artist, and I
didn't believe he'd appreciate her work, but
just spend her savings careless. That's his mother
you've got in your hand, and that's
him, layin' on the mantelpiece torn across the
middle."</p>

<p>Eliza's aspect as she talked was wild. Mrs.
Wright picked up the torn pieces and fitted
them together. In fancy she saw Eliza rending
the card. She felt that she understood all; the
heart-break, the starvation fare of tea, tears,
and misery, and the blank future.</p>

<p>"His name's Philip Sidney, and his mother
was Mrs. Ballard's niece and namesake. Yesterday
he came. He was altogether different
from what I expected. He took a load off o' my
mind and heart. I don't begrudge him anything."</p>

<p>"You're sorry, then, that you tore this
handsome picture."</p>

<p>"Oh, I didn't&mdash;'cause Mrs. Ballard set
such store by it. I only turned it to the wall.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
'Twas he tore it. He said it was too pretty
or something. He does look different. The
picture's kind o' dreamin' lookin' and he's so
awake he&mdash;well, he sparkles."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wright smiled at the haggard speaker.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad you like him. Has he come to
New York to study?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he had to be a mining engineer when
he wanted to paint. So now he's goin' to study
with Mrs. Ballard's money."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;I remember," said Mrs. Wright,
thoughtfully regarding the sketches. "Mrs.
Ballard told me about him in the spring." She
looked up again at her hostess. "You've been
through a great deal, Eliza," she said, "and
you've tried to go alone."</p>

<p>"I had to go alone," returned Eliza fiercely;
"but I can be honest if I am lonely and I won't
sit down at your table without your knowin'
that I'm a sinner. Don't talk religion to me
either," she added, "'cause I ain't the kind it
would do any good to."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wright came back to her chair and her
eyes were thoughtful.</p>

<p>"I have a better idea still," she said. "For
how long have you this apartment?"</p>

<p>"One week more."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, only a week. Then, supposing you
come and live with me this winter."</p>

<p>Eliza leaned back in her chair, speechless.
The grey wall of the future slowly dissolved.
The possibility of friendship&mdash;of a home&mdash;was
actually unnerving in its contrast to all she
had steeled herself to endure.</p>

<p>"Come and help me, Eliza," went on the
gentle voice. "Show me how to meet an island
winter. I believe between us we can make a
cosy sort of season of it."</p>

<p>"Cosy!" echoed Eliza's dry lips.</p>

<p>"Yes. There by the gnarled little apple trees,
handicapped by winter winds, and the forlorn
little chicken-house that stands near the orchard.
Do you remember that?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Eliza mechanically.
"'T wa'n't always a chicken-house. Polly
Ann Foster built it 'cause she quarrelled with
her son and wouldn't live with him. I was
a little girl and we were all scared of her.
When she died they began using it for the
hens."</p>

<p>"Well, it's empty and forlorn now. Miss
Foster can't keep chickens and go back to Portland
every fall. That's our only near neighbor,
you remember."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"I remember. Why should you be such an
angel to me?" burst forth Eliza.</p>

<p>"Is that being an angel? Why, I'm so glad.
You know I might be a little bit lonely at the
island. Mr. Wright is pretty sleepy in the
evening and the house rambles. We'll shut up
part of it, Eliza, won't we?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Wright!" exclaimed the lonely
woman, every trace of her fierceness gone.
"What a godsend you're givin' me."</p>

<p>"Then it's settled; and Violet will be so glad.
She isn't quite pleased with our plan for the
winter."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">BROTHER AND SISTER</p>


<p>Kathleen Fabian sat at her desk, deeply engrossed
in the theme she was writing, when
her brother's name was brought to her.</p>

<p>The expression of her face as she took the
card did not indicate that the surprise was
wholly joyous. She frowned and bit her lip, and
an anxious look grew in her eyes as she went out
into the hall to meet the visitor, who advanced
with bounds, and grasped her in one arm, giving
her cheek a brotherly peck.</p>

<p>"What has happened, Edgar?" she asked as
he led her back into her room.</p>

<p>"I've come to see you, that's all," was the
rejoinder.</p>

<p>Edgar Fabian was an airy youth, carefully
arrayed in the height of fashion. His fair hair
was brushed until it reflected the light, and
his jaunty assurance was wont to carry all before
it.</p>

<p>"Is anything wrong at home?" insisted his
sister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly not."</p>

<p>They were now inside the room and the
young man closed the door.</p>

<p>"Well, I haven't any money," said Kathleen
bluntly,&mdash;"at least, not for you!"</p>

<p>Edgar was but little taller than she, and, as
she looked at him now, her serious slender face
opposed to his boyish one, her peculiar slow
speech, in which her teeth scarcely closed,
sounding lazy beside his crispness, she seemed
the elder of the two.</p>

<p>"This leaping at conclusions is too feminine a
weakness for you to indulge in, Kath," was the
rejoinder as the visitor slid out of a silk-lined
overcoat; but he rested his gaze upon his sister's
dark hair rather than the eyes beneath. "I like
your hospitality," he added. "I hope it isn't
presumption for me to remove my coat. Try to
control your joy when your brother comes up
from New York to see you."</p>

<p>"Of course I should always be glad to see you
if&mdash;if you'd let me," was the reply.</p>

<p>"What's to prevent?" inquired the visitor
cheerfully.</p>

<p>"My diary," was the laconic response.</p>

<p>"Oh, you make me tired," said Edgar, taking
out a cigarette-case. "May I?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," returned Kathleen, speaking with her
characteristic deliberation.</p>

<p>"You may have one, too"; he offered his
case, still standing, since she did not sit. He
smiled as he said it; the evenness of his teeth
and the glee of his smile had melted much ice
before now.</p>

<p>"No, thanks," she answered coldly.</p>

<p>He gave an exclamation.</p>

<p>"Oh, your grave and reverend senior airs
won't go down with me, you know." He
sniffed suspiciously. "Some one has been having
a whiff here this morning."</p>

<p>"It wasn't I."</p>

<p>"Well, it was somebody; and some one more
critical than I is liable to drop in here and notice
it. Just to save you trouble, I'll light up. Better
take one. It's your golden opportunity."</p>

<p>Again he offered the case, and now Kathleen
took a cigarette mechanically. She still questioned
her brother's debonair countenance.</p>

<p>"Well," he said impatiently, after a moment
of silence, "are we going to stand here until
dinner-time like two tenpins?"</p>

<p>"Are you going to stay until dinner-time?"</p>

<p>"Why," with another effort at gayety, "if
you go on like this and positively won't take no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
for an answer, perhaps I shall be obliged to.
Say, Kath, what's the matter with you? You
used to be a good fellow. College has ruined
you. I didn't treat you like this when you came
to see me."</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Edgar," Kathleen's drawl became
very nearly an exclamation. "I was
thinking so hard."</p>

<p>She dropped into a chair and he lighted his
cigarette, and bending forward allowed her to
draw the flame into her own.</p>

<p>"Now, this is something like it," remarked
the young man, sinking upon a leather-covered
divan. He picked up a guitar that lay at its
head, and strummed lightly upon it. "Think of
your giving house-room to anything so light-minded
as a guitar!" he added, his disapproving
eyes roving about the entire apartment. "This
room looks more like a hermit's cell every time
I come."</p>

<p>"No," rejoined Kathleen, with her soft laziness
of speech, and blowing a ring of smoke
upon the air, "it is only that you have time to
forget between your visits."</p>

<p>Edgar removed his cigarette and began to
murmur "The Owl and the Pussy Cat," in a
tenor voice calculated to pour oil on troubled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
waters, while he struck the accompanying
chords with a sure touch.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">"They took some honey, and plenty of money,</div>
    <div class="verse">Wrapped up in a five-pound note!"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>he sang. "Think of it!" he groaned, pausing to
save the life of his cigarette; "plenty of money!
Who wouldn't be an owl or a pussy-cat!"</p>

<p>Kathleen's eyes narrowed.</p>

<p>"You speak of the rarity of my visits," he
went on. "I suppose you think it is nothing to
take a few hours out of a business day to run up
here."</p>

<p>Kathleen smiled. "On the contrary, I think
it so much of a thing that it always startles me
to get your card on a week day, and you seem to
have other uses for your Sundays."</p>

<p>"Very well," returned her brother, strumming
the guitar with conscious rectitude;
"know then that the Administration sent me
up here to-day on business."</p>

<p>"With me?"</p>

<p>"No" (singing)&mdash;</p>

<p>
'Drink to me only with thine eyes, and I will pledge&mdash;'"
</p>

<p>"Edgar!" protested the girl lazily, "it's too
early in the day for that."</p>

<p>"Hello, grave and reverend senior," he re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>torted.
"I didn't know you were so much of a
connoisseur."</p>

<p>The girl's reply had a sad note.</p>

<p>"I wish you would do something with that
voice," she said.</p>

<p>The singer smiled. He was now smoking
again, and strumming the melody of the song.
Perhaps he was thinking that he had done a
good deal with his voice.</p>

<p>"I don't know that it has been altogether
wasted," he replied.</p>

<p>"Carrying off the honors as the singing-girl
in a college play isn't what I mean."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sure it isn't," scoffed the possessor
of the voice. "I'd take long odds that what you
mean involves something that would come
under the head of work spelled with a capital
W&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Think of a <em>man butterfly</em>!" ejaculated Kathleen,
removing her cigarette and her drawl
for an unwonted verbal explosion. "Edgar, <em>I</em>
should have been the man, and you the girl in
our family."</p>

<p>"I should object," he rejoined calmly, all his
attention apparently concentrated on the compassing
of some intricate fingering of the guitar
strings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Think of your rooms at college and this!"
went on Kathleen.</p>

<p>"I'd like mighty well to have a squint at the
loved and lost to take the taste of this out of my
mouth," returned the visitor imperturbably.</p>

<p>"How is father?" asked Kathleen, relapsing
into her usual manner.</p>

<p>"Smaht," rejoined Edgar.</p>

<p>At the reminder of Brewster's Island, Kathleen's
eyes smiled, then grew grave. "I can't
bear to have you call father the Administration,"
she said.</p>

<p>"Why not?&mdash;you didn't want me to call
him Governor."</p>

<p>"It sounds so&mdash;so disrespectful."</p>

<p>"Not to me. I think it suggests salaams."</p>

<p>"No, Edgar&mdash;slams; but I don't want to
joke."</p>

<p>"I'm sure of it," interpolated the guitar-playing
one.</p>

<p>"Stop that noise a minute, please."</p>

<p>He obeyed.</p>

<p>"I wish you wouldn't speak of father so
coldly."</p>

<p>"Then it'll be likely to be hotly, and at
that you'd make a fuss," returned the youth
doggedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>"He is a good father," declared the girl, the
lingering words coming devoutly.</p>

<p>"Yes," retorted Edgar drily. "Perhaps, if
your little day-dream could come true and you
be the son, you wouldn't think so."</p>

<p>"I believe it is father's fault largely," said
Kathleen. "He began by spoiling you."</p>

<p>"Then, if I'm spoiled, what's the use of
kicking?&mdash;and if he's done it he must pay for
it; but that's just what he won't do&mdash;pay for
it."</p>

<p>The speaker stubbed the light out of his
cigarette and tossed it on the table. He rose
and walked the floor.</p>

<p>"He has put you in his office," said Kathleen.
"He will give you every chance to rise."</p>

<p>"Yes, and meanwhile pays me a salary
smaller than the allowance he gave me at
college."</p>

<p>"Because," said the girl, "he found that you
couldn't even keep within that. He knew you
must wake up."</p>

<p>"What occasion?" demanded Edgar, standing
still to gesture. "I'm the only son. Look at
the money he has."</p>

<p>"And has worked for; <em>worked</em> for, Edgar.
Can't you understand? Supposing you had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
worked like that, and had a son who dipped into
the bag with both hands and threw your money
away."</p>

<p>"I don't want to throw it away. I get one
hundred cents' worth of fun out of every dollar
I spend. What more does he want? I didn't
ask to be born, did I? I didn't ask to have
expensive tastes. Why should I have to ride in
a taxicab?"</p>

<p>"You don't. There are the street cars."</p>

<p>Edgar's blond face turned upon her angrily.
"When do you suppose I want a machine?
When I'm doddering around with a cane?"</p>

<p>"Earn it, then."</p>

<p>"Yes, I can on a petty few hundreds a year!"</p>

<p>"You drive down with father every morning,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't. I have to get there before he
does."</p>

<p>Kathleen laughed. "What an outrage!"</p>

<p>"I take the car first and then it goes back for
him," said Edgar sulkily.</p>

<p>"Oh, the cruelty of some parents!" drawled
Kathleen, knocking the ash from her cigarette.
"The idea of Peter going back for father. He
should stand in Wall Street awaiting your
orders."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, he shouldn't, but I should have a motor
of my own. The Ad. is more old-fashioned
than any of the other fathers in our set."
The speaker paused and gestured defensively.
"You'll get off all that ancient stuff about the
new generation wanting to begin where the old
left off. Of course we do. Why not? I hope my
son will begin where I leave off."</p>

<p>Kathleen gave her one-sided smile&mdash;her
Mona Lisa smile her admirers called it:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where you leave off is not liable to be a bed
of roses if you keep on as you've begun." She
looked up at her brother gravely as she tapped
the end of her cigarette and dropped it in
the ash receiver. "Why don't you use your
brains?" she asked. "Can't you see that the
more father notices that you have no ambition,
the tighter he will draw the rein?"</p>

<p>"I have plenty of ambition."</p>

<p>"For work?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you make me tired!"</p>

<p>The young man resumed his impatient walk.</p>

<p>The sister leaned back in her chair, her dark
eyes following him, without the hint of a smile.</p>

<p>"I'd like to see you tired," she said seriously.</p>

<p>He turned on her. "Ever see me after a polo
game?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"But life isn't a game, Edgar."</p>

<p>He opened his eyes at her and grimaced
scornfully.</p>

<p>"The grave and reverend senior again;
nearly ready to graduate, and inform the world
that</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">'Life is real, life is earnest,</div>
    <div class="verse">And the grave is not its goal!'</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Might as well be in the grave at once as dig and
grind the days away. Heaven help us when you
get home! I suppose you must go through the
fine-spun theory stage like the usual attack of
measles."</p>

<p>"Measles are catching," remarked Kathleen
quietly.</p>

<p>"Exactly! but I'm mighty glad I'm immune
from the know-it-all disease."</p>

<p>"That would mean that you'd had it, Edgar,
and you never did have it; not even a rash.
Open the window, please. We're a little blue in
here."</p>

<p>Edgar threw open the unoffending window
with a force that threatened the mechanism.</p>

<p>"No doubt," he said, "you'd like to have me
live, like that cowboy, in a stable, and get my
own meals."</p>

<p>"A garage would suit you better, I suppose,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
returned Kathleen. "What are you talking
about?"</p>

<p>"Hasn't mother written you of the genius
who has come out of the wild and woolly to get
his Pegasus curried in New York?"</p>

<p>"Has mother taken up a genius?&mdash;Mother,
of all people!"</p>

<p>"Why, she's had him at the house, and insists
on my being civil to him; but I haven't
seen him yet. I get enough of him right at the
breakfast and dinner table without hunting up
the stable. His ambition is at the bottom of
my coffee cup, and his genius for hard work is
served as an entre every night."</p>

<p>"Oh,"&mdash;Kathleen's face gained a ray of
interest,&mdash;"you mean that cousin of ours."</p>

<p>"He's no cousin," retorted Edgar. "He's
one of mother's fifty-seven varieties, a sort of
step-neighbor-in-law of ours. When father and
mother were out at the mine they met him. I
think it was up to him to stay out there and
make that mine pay. I think if he'd shown a
little genius for hard work right there, it would
have been more to the point."</p>

<p>"Yes, mother wrote me." Kathleen's tone
was tinged with the interest in her eyes.
"What is his name, now?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sidney," responded Edgar with open disgust.
"Oh, I'm authority on his name all
right,&mdash;Philip Sidney; I've had it dinged into
my ears faithfully."</p>

<p>"A name to live up to," remarked the girl.
"It was interesting, Aunt Mary leaving him her
money."</p>

<p>"It would have been more interesting if she'd
had anything to leave."</p>

<p>Edgar had thrown himself back on the divan
and was watching curtains and smoke draw out
the window.</p>

<p>"Do you remember," continued his sister,
"what nice cookies Aunt Mary used to give us
when we were little? Mother felt sorry not to
be here when she died."</p>

<p>"Oh, mother's ripping," declared Edgar, his
cheerfulness restored by some inspiriting memory.
"She's had a hand-to-hand, knock-down-and-drag-out
with the old gargoyle that holds
the fort over there at Aunt Mary's."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" drawled Kathleen
with faint disgust.</p>

<p>"Mother gave a graphic account of the fray
at dinner one night. I wasn't giving the story
my whole attention, but I gathered that she
and the doughty Eliza each got hold of one end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
of Aunt Mary's camel's hair shawl and had a tug
of war; and Eliza's cat won the day for her by
jumping on mother and nearly clawing her furs
off."</p>

<p>"Edgar," protested Kathleen, "your bump
of respect is an intaglio!"</p>

<p>"Well, I think I've got it about right. There
were diamonds mixed up in it too. I believe
Eliza wears a diamond tiara at her work so as to
keep it away from mother; while the parent of
the worshipful Philip came in for a diamond
necklace, and mother was left nothing but cold
neglect."</p>

<p>"Absurd!" breathed Kathleen. "Aunt Mary
was poor as a church mouse."</p>

<p>"Well, whatever happened, the fur was rising
on the back of mother's neck, and I didn't
know but there would be a silver lining to the
cloud and she'd cut Philip Sidney; but," with a
heavy sigh, "no such luck. The cowboy still
gallops his Pegasus over my prostrate body
every meal."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by a stable?" asked
Kathleen.</p>

<p>"Why, Pegasus has to have one, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Is that all? Are you only being witty?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it. You know the literal truth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
is all I'm ever up to. The genius has a room
over a stable, and an oil stove!"</p>

<p>"Why a stable?"</p>

<p>"Convenient for Pegasus, I suppose," responded
Edgar carelessly. "Beside, doubtless
he would feel out of place in any abode more
civilized."</p>

<p>"Edgar Fabian, that's nonsense. I remember
his mother, when she came East years ago,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"They're as poor as Job's turkey," said
Edgar with a careless shrug. "That's why he
jumped at Aunt Mary's pittance like a trout at
a fly."</p>

<p>"Oh, Edgar, what an object-lesson for you!"
Kathleen clasped her hands.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course!" ejaculated Edgar, his even
teeth very much clenched.</p>

<p>"You ought to go to see him!"</p>

<p>"So I've heard," with intense sarcasm.
"Mother has bored the life out of me."</p>

<p>"It isn't civil not to," said Kathleen, relapsing
into languor. "He's a sort of a relative."</p>

<p>"Yes. The sort to keep away from. If I went
up there, it would be to take his mahl-stick and
smash his face."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nice, hospitable plan," remarked Kathleen.
"Possibly he wouldn't permit it."</p>

<p>"Oh, I've no doubt he'd think it was real
mean and pick up a fan and slap me on the
wrist. Oh, forget him! Say, Kath," as if with
sudden remembrance, "do you know I came off
without my purse to-day?"</p>

<p>The girl's eyes gained a curious expression.
She was silent a moment, hands clasped around
her knee. Under her gaze her brother picked up
the guitar again and his nervous fingers swept
the strings.</p>

<p>"I thought you said this was a business trip."</p>

<p>"It is. Go down and ask them at the bank if
I didn't put a bee in their bonnet this morning."</p>

<p>"Then the house pays your expenses. Your
purse didn't have to suffer."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, if you want the literal truth, I'm
flat broke."</p>

<p>"You always are flat broke at this time in the
month. Why shouldn't <em>I</em> be?&mdash;as a matter of
fact, I am."</p>

<p>Edgar frowned. "What have you been
buying?"</p>

<p>"A new microscope. I've saved for it,
Edgar."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl cast a warm glance across the room
to where, on a table, stood a tall slender object
covered with a cloth.</p>

<p>"Saved for it!" was the disgusted response.
"Shameful idea when the Ad. could just as well
buy you an observatory."</p>

<p>"I don't believe father is nearly as rich as you
think he is," said the girl defensively.</p>

<p>"He's the prize tight-wad. That's what he
is. Look at our summers! Isn't it enough that
instead of Newport the Fabians rusticate on
Brewster's Island?"</p>

<p>"He met mother there. He loves it."</p>

<p>"Well, I can tell you, mother would exchange
a whole lot of sentiment for one good whirl at
Newport or some other place where there are
live ones! Say, Kath, be a good fellow. You
can spare a dime or so. Ten dollars would be
better than nothing. I'll give it back the first of
the month, honor bright. Think of my having to
depend on taxis! It would make angels weep."</p>

<p>The sister continued to regard him and he
reddened under the pensive gaze, and twanged
the guitar.</p>

<p>"You never have paid me back the first of
the month and I wish you wouldn't promise,"
she said at last; "but I'll tell you what I'll do.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
I'm coming home to spend Sunday and I will
give you the ten dollars&mdash;it's all I have just
now&mdash;if you will take me to see that cousin
of ours."</p>

<p>"What cousin?" asked Edgar.</p>

<p>"Aunt Mary's heir. The artist."</p>

<p>"Why are you determined to stuff him down
my throat? He is absolutely no kin to us and
has no demand on us. I decline."</p>

<p>"Then I shall go with mother," declared
Kathleen, in her laziest drawl. "I'm sure she
will take me. I am interested in his determination.
I want to see&mdash;his oil stove. I want to
pat Pegasus."</p>

<p>"Go, then, and much good may it do you!"
Edgar put down the guitar and started up.
"Where's the ten, Kath? Awful sorry to bother
you."</p>

<p>The girl did not rise. She shook her head.</p>

<p>"You haven't earned it. I've decided you
must work for this one, before it follows its
predecessors to that bourne from which no
bank-note returneth."</p>

<p>There was an unusual sparkle in the eyes that
met the blue ones.</p>

<p>"You said you could go with mother," protested
Edgar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can if I have to, but I prefer to hunt up
stables with a man."</p>

<p>"Oh, confound it! you always get your own
way. Fork over, then. I'll go with you; but
it just means fastening him right on us. We'll
be cousins then for sure."</p>

<p>Kathleen went to her closet and reappeared
with the ten dollar bill. With a gesture of farewell
she touched her finger to her lips and bestowed
the kiss on the bank-note.</p>

<p>Her brother looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"Great Scott! I've got to hike for that
train," he said; and wriggling into his overcoat
he kissed his sister's cheek, and hurried away.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">THE FLITTING</p>


<p>It was Eliza's last day in the apartment. Out
of respect to probable scruples on the part of
her future hostess as to travelling on Sunday,
she had planned to sit idle this Sabbath day,
although everything was packed and she was
ready to start.</p>

<p>By Mrs. Wright's advice she had sold nearly
all the shabby furnishings of the apartment.
She had eaten a picnic luncheon in the forlorn
kitchen, from whence even the gambolling
kittens had fled to the bottom of Eliza's trunk,
and now sat on a camp-chair in the middle of
the empty parlor, as solitary as Alexander Selkirk
on his island, monarch of all she surveyed,
which was a pair of green eyes glowering at her
from behind the wire network in the side of a
wicker basket, which reposed on the only other
chair in the room.</p>

<p>Stern and inexorable looked Eliza sitting in
state on the camp-chair, and furious glared the
jewel eyes back at her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>"You've got to get used to it, Pluto," she
said. "Do you suppose I like it any better than
you do? I don't know as you're so bad off
either. I think I'd like to be put in a bag and
carried to Brewster's Island with no care of
cars or boats or anything else. You always do
get the best of it."</p>

<p>Eliza looked very haggard. It had been a
wrenching week, packing her dear one's belongings,
and selling into careless, grudging hands
the old furniture with its tender associations.</p>

<p>Philip had been too busy to come to her aid.
They had exchanged notes. She had addressed
him at the Fabians', and he had replied that he
had taken a room, and asked that his belongings
be stacked up somewhere. He promised that he
would come for them early Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>So now she was waiting, her capable hands
folded in her black alpaca lap, and her face expressing
endurance.</p>

<p>"I'm countin' the hours, Pluto," she declared.
"This place is misery to me now. I feel
just as much in a strange garret as you do in
that basket. I just wish Mr. Sidney'd come
and take his things and then there won't be
much more daylight to look around here in.
And I hope you won't act like all possessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
when we start for the train nor when we get on
it."</p>

<p>"Meow!" cried Pluto, exasperated.</p>

<p>"There now!" exclaimed Eliza, in trepidation&mdash;"you
do that just once when the train's
standin' still, and where'll we be! I've always
thought you had a little more intelligence than
the law allows; and if you go to actin' like an
alley cat you'll disappoint me dreadfully!"</p>

<p>Eliza rose anxiously and threw herself on her
knees beside the basket and opened it. Pluto
sprang out, and she caught him and pressed her
thin cheek against his fur in a rare caress. Her
eyes stung in her effort to repress tears.</p>

<p>"Oh, law! I'm sick o' myself," she muttered.
"Cryin'! cryin'! gracious, what a fool! I'd
ought to sold you to somebody, I suppose,"&mdash;she
clung tighter to the handsome creature
and buried her eyes in his glossy coat,&mdash;"or
given you away, more likely. Who'd want to
pay anything for a cat that don't know how
bothersome it's goin' to be to get the right train,
and hasn't the decency to keep his mouth shut,
and&mdash;Oh!" as a knock sounded on the door.
"There he is now."</p>

<p>The glow of Eliza's one interview with Mrs.
Ballard's heir had faded long ago. The sordid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
and wounding events of the week had eclipsed
whatever cheer he had brought her, and it was
only as one of the events of her flitting that she
looked forward to his advent this afternoon,
and the departure of the last and most intimate
of her dear one's possessions.</p>

<p>The knock on the door preceded its immediate
opening.</p>

<p>"May I come in?"</p>

<p>The long step took the little hall in three
strides.</p>

<p>The sight that met the newcomer's eyes was
the bare room, with Eliza kneeling in front of
an open basket, clasping Pluto to her breast.
The woman's face and posture were dramatic.</p>

<p>"Deserted!" was the word that rose to Phil's
lips, but he repressed it. He would not twit on
facts; but his all-observing eyes shone.</p>

<p>"I'm always wanting to paint you, Eliza,"
he said. "Sometime I will, too."</p>

<p>"Me!" returned Eliza drearily. "You'll be
hard up when you take me."</p>

<p>"So far as that goes, I'm hard up now.
That's chronic," responded Phil cheerfully.
"What are you doing&mdash;not taking leave of
that king among cats? If you're leaving him
behind, I speak for him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>"H'm!" exclaimed Eliza, loosening her clasp
of her pet and rising. "You'd made a bad
bargain if you took Pluto." She removed the
basket from its chair. "Sit down, Mr. Sidney,"
she said wearily, resuming her own seat. "It's
too forlorn for you to stay, but maybe you'd
like to ketch your breath before you take the
things."</p>

<p>Philip picked up the basket and looked curiously
at its wire window.</p>

<p>"Yes," continued Eliza. "I'm taking Pluto,
so I had to have that. It was an extravagance,
and he ain't worth it. I despise to see folks
cartin' cats and dogs around. I didn't think
I'd ever come to it; but somehow I'm&mdash;used
to that selfish critter, and he's&mdash;he's all the
folks I've got. It never once came to me that
you'd take him."</p>

<p>"Indeed I would," replied Phil; "and wait
till you see the place I have for him. Rats and
mice while you wait, I suppose, though I
haven't seen any yet."</p>

<p>"Oh, well," returned Eliza hastily, her eyes
following Pluto as he rubbed himself against
Phil's leg. "I've got the basket now. I guess
I'll have to use it."</p>

<p>"It's a shame I haven't been here to help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
you," said Phil. "You've had a hard week, I
know, but I've had a busy one."</p>

<p>"You've got a room, you say," said Eliza
listlessly. "Rats and mice. That don't sound
very good."</p>

<p>Phil smiled. "I don't know,&mdash;as I say, I
haven't seen them yet; but Pluto would be a
fine guard to keep them off my blankets. I
don't believe, though, there's been any grain in
there for a good while."</p>

<p>"Grain!" repeated Eliza.</p>

<p>Phil laughed. "I'll tell you about it later;
but first, may I have the things? I have an
expressman down at the door. I rode over here
with him in state. Good thing I didn't meet
Mrs. Fabian."</p>

<p>Eliza's thin lip curled as she rose. She led
Philip to a room, in the middle of which was
gathered a heterogeneous collection of articles.
"In this box is the paintin' things," she said,
touching a wooden case. "In this barrel is some
dishes. I couldn't get anything for 'em anyway,
and you wrote you was going to get your
own breakfasts."</p>

<p>"Capital," put in Phil; "and here's a bedstead."</p>

<p>"Yes, and the spring and mattress," re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>turned
Eliza. "It's Mrs. Ballard's bed. I
couldn't sell it."</p>

<p>Philip regarded the disconnected pieces dubiously&mdash;"I
guess I'd have to be amputated at
the knees to use that."</p>

<p>"Well,"&mdash;Eliza shook her head quickly.
"Take it anyway, and do what you've a mind
to with it, only don't tell me. The beddin''s in
the barrel with the dishes&mdash;you said you'd be
glad of a chair, so here's one, and the two in the
parlor are for you. You can take 'em right
along. I haven't got very long to wait anyway.
I calc'late to go to the station early."</p>

<p>Phil touched her shoulder with his hand.</p>

<p>"I'll see that you get to the station early
enough."</p>

<p>"You mustn't think o' me," said Eliza, as
Phil picked up some of the furniture and started
for the stairs.</p>

<p>When he returned for the next load he brought
the expressman with him. Together they took
the last of the articles down the stairway.</p>

<p>Eliza stood at the top and watched the final
descent.</p>

<p>"Good-bye Mr. Sidney," she said.</p>

<p>He smiled brightly up at her across a couple
of chairs, and the easel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good-bye for five minutes."</p>

<p>"No, no," said Eliza; "don't you come
back." She winked violently toward the receding
cap of the expressman. "You'd better
ride right over with the things just the way
you came."</p>

<p>"All right," responded Phil laughing. "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bon
voyage!</i>"</p>

<p>"Hey?" asked Eliza.</p>

<p>"Have a good trip. My respects to Pluto."</p>

<p>She went back into the apartment and closed
the door. It seemed emptier, stiller than ever
after the little flurry of moving.</p>

<p>"It was clever of him," she thought gratefully,
"not to let the other man handle the
easel."</p>

<p>Now, indeed, desolation settled upon Eliza
Brewster. Pluto's short tail stiffened in the
majestic disapproval with which he walked
about the room in search of an oasis of comfort.</p>

<p>Eliza heard his protesting meows. She stood
still at the window looking out on the grey
November sky. "I haven't got a chair to sit
down on, Pluto," she said. "It's got past
cryin'!"</p>

<p>She took out the gold-faced watch that was
ticking against her thin bosom. Two hours yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
before there would be any reason in going to the
station. Suddenly it occurred to her that she
had placed flannel in the bottom of the cat's
travelling-basket. This would be the golden
opportunity to endear the spot to his forlorn
feline heart.</p>

<p>She tucked the watch back in its hiding-place.
"Here, kitty, kitty, kitty!" she cried.</p>

<p>No response. The receding meows had ceased.
She looked perplexed; then an illuminating
thought occurred to her. Tables there were
none, but the square top of the kitchen range
remained. On this she had spread clean papers
and upon them had laid her coat and hat, and
the shabby boa and muff of black astrachan
which had belonged to her dear one.</p>

<p>She hastened down the hall. Her intuition
had not failed. Upon this bed, his glossy coat
revealing the rustiness of the garments, lay
Pluto curled up, regardless of vicissitudes.</p>

<p>Eliza had scarcely swept him off his bed when
the outer door of the apartment opened again,
and closed.</p>

<p>"There," called a cheerful voice; "that's
finished. Business before pleasure."</p>

<p>Eliza hastened out into the hall. "You, Mr.
Sidney?" she exclaimed in surprise. "Why,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
you haven't had time to get over there. Is
your room so near?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. We've been making the wagon
artistically safe, so as not to smash any of Aunt
Mary's valuables." The speaker, strong and
breezy, smiled reassuringly into Eliza's anxious
face.</p>

<p>"You'd ought to gone with him," she said.
"Do you suppose the folks'll let him in all
right."</p>

<p>"There aren't any folks but English sparrows,"
returned Phil. "I don't think they'll
object."</p>

<p>"What are you sayin'?" demanded Eliza.
"If there's a house in this city where there
ain't any folks, I didn't know it. It's queer,
ain't it, Mr. Sidney, that it's folks make loneliness.
Now, this buildin''s running over with
<em>folks</em>, but there ain't an apartment where I
could go in and say good-bye. They're always
movin' in and movin' out like ants, and it makes
it worse than if there was nobody. It was clever
of you to come back, but don't you stay, 'cause
there ain't any place to sit but the floor, and
I'm going in just a few minutes to leave the key
where I promised the agent I would, and then
on to the station."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>"When does your train go?" asked Phil.</p>

<p>"I ain't just certain," replied Eliza evasively.
"I'll get there in good season."</p>

<p>"I'm sure you will." Phil's eyes looked very
kind. "How did you happen to take a night
train?"</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't know as Mrs. Wright would
want me to travel on Sunday."</p>

<p>"Isn't it Sunday in the afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Not after six o'clock," replied Eliza hastily.
"We could play dominoes after six o'clock when
I was a youngster."</p>

<p>"Aha," said Phil. "Then that train doesn't
go till after six. It isn't yet three."</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Sidney,"&mdash;Eliza was frowning
at her own blunder,&mdash;"I wish you wouldn't
trouble yourself. The station's nice and warm.
I expect Pluto'll act like all possessed, but I
didn't calc'late to have any comfort with him.
I'd been practisin' with him in the basket before
you came to-day."</p>

<p>Eliza's careworn brow went to her visitor's
heart.</p>

<p>"Where are you to leave the key? I'll take it
for you."</p>

<p>"Oh, you needn't. It's the janitor, right
here in the buildin'."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then it's all clear sailing," said Phil. "Get
on your things, Eliza."</p>

<p>"It's a little early," she demurred. "If it
wasn't for Pluto I wouldn't care; but you go
along, Mr. Sidney, and don't think anything
more about us. You ought to go and see that
those goods get in all right."</p>

<p>"We'll be there to meet them. Do you suppose
I would let you leave New York without
seeing where I'm going to live? And do you
suppose I'd let you out of my sight anyway till
I put you on the train?"</p>

<p>"Dear me!" returned Eliza, fluttered, but
feeling as if the sun had suddenly peeped
through the November clouds. "I never
thought&mdash;" she stopped undecidedly.</p>

<p>"Well, I did," said Phil heartily. "It's a
shame that I haven't helped you any this hard
week. Where's Pluto?"</p>

<p>"He may be back on the stove again," returned
Eliza. "I don't dare take my eyes off
him." She moved quickly toward the kitchen,
and there on her habiliments lay the cat; but
at sight of her he leaped guiltily to the floor.</p>

<p>Phil, following, laughed. "Well, things have
come to a pretty pass when you have to hang
your coat up on the stove." He looked about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the spotless place. "I wonder if this apartment
will ever be so clean again."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm clean," admitted Eliza. "Mr.
Sidney,"&mdash;she paused again, her coat in her
hand, and faced him,&mdash;"you don't want to go
traipsing through the streets o' New York with
an old woman and a cat!"</p>

<p>"That's where you're wrong," returned Phil.
"You're the only girl I have in town. It's
highly proper that we should go walking of a
Sunday afternoon. You get on your things, and
I'll wrestle with Pluto."</p>

<p>The cat, suspecting that whatever plan was
afoot was not entirely according to his taste,
led Phil a short chase; but all the havens which
usually harbored his periods of rebellion having
disappeared, he was soon captured, and when
Eliza, hatted and coated, entered the living-room,
Phil had laid the cat on the flannel in the
bottom of the basket, and was keeping him
there by reassuring caresses.</p>

<p>"Ain't he just as kind as he can be!"
thought Eliza.</p>

<p>"Ready?" asked Phil, and closed the basket.
He met Pluto's gaze through the window.</p>

<p>"It's all right, old chap," he laughed.</p>

<p>He was not unmindful of the advantage of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
diversion of Eliza's mind, in leaving the apartment
forever. He had a green memory of her
stormy emotion. He tried to take the key from
her now as they stepped outside.</p>

<p>"No," she said briefly, "I'll close this chapter
myself," and she locked the door.</p>

<p>Philip balanced the basket ostentatiously.
"Believe me," said he, "Pluto is some cat!
How did you expect to get on with him
alone?"</p>

<p>"I calc'lated to get a boy," replied Eliza in an
unsteady voice. Memories were crowding her.</p>

<p>"Well, you have one," returned Phil, leading
the way downstairs.</p>

<p>"But I'm strong, too. You've heard about
the woman that carried the calf uphill every
day till it was a cow? I've had Pluto ever since
his eyes was open."</p>

<p>"Well, you'd need some hill-climbing with
him to fit you for taking the elevated."</p>

<p>"Yes, I did some dread those steps. It's
certainly clever of you, Mr. Sidney. They say
the lame and the lazy are always provided
for."</p>

<p>Thus Eliza Brewster left her home of years.
She gave the key to the janitor and went out
into the dull, damp November afternoon with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
her strong escort, whose good cheer again impressed
her consciousness as a wonderful thing
to have any relation to her own life.</p>

<p>"You've learned your way around real
quick," said Eliza as they plunged into the
nearest subway station.</p>

<p>"This is all bluff, Eliza, and you're the most
trustful woman in the world. I want to go
somewhere near Gramercy Park; but if we
come out at Harlem I shall try to look as if I
lived there."</p>

<p>"Gramercy Park!" exclaimed Eliza; and she
thought&mdash;"Well, at that rate, Mrs. Ballard's
money won't last long."</p>

<p>"I didn't know," she said aloud, "as you'd
feel like gettin' a room in a real fashionable
neighborhood."</p>

<p>"I'll bet," she thought acutely, "that's Mrs.
Fabian's doin's."</p>

<p>The subway train came crashing in, and
Pluto crouched in his basket.</p>

<p>Eliza's suspicions and anxieties increased
as, after leaving the subway, their journey
continued; and when they finally came into a
region of old and aristocratic dwellings, her
eyes were round and she could no longer keep
silent. It was an outrage, an imposition, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
have influenced the young art-student to commit
himself to a home in these surroundings.</p>

<p>"I'd 'a' been a whole lot better person to 'a'
helped you find a place than Mrs. Fabian," she
said, more and more impressed with the incongruity
of the situation. To be sure, Phil looked
like a prince and fit for any environment; but
not while trudging along with a shabby, grey-haired
woman, and carrying a cat-basket.</p>

<p>"I know, I know, Eliza," he returned, with
gay recognition of her perturbation and disapproval.
"I'm sorry sometimes that elegance
and luxury are necessary to me. It's the penalty
of blue blood. Mrs. Fabian had nothing to
do with this; but I had to find my level, Eliza.
Blood will tell."</p>

<p>"You said rats and mice," she returned
mechanically. "Are you sure you've got the
right street?"</p>

<p>"Sure as a homing pigeon;&mdash;by the way, I
might keep pigeons! I never thought of it."</p>

<p>"For the rats?" inquired Eliza with some
asperity.</p>

<p>She had always heard that geniuses were
erratic. Also that without exception they were
ignorant of the value of money. Poor Mrs.
Ballard! What a small space of time it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
take for her little capital to be licked up as by a
fierce heat.</p>

<p>"This way," cried her escort, and swung
Pluto's basket triumphantly as he turned
abruptly into an alley.</p>

<p>Eliza caught her breath in the midst of her
resentment. "You do go in the back way,
then."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it!" retorted Phil. "My proud
spirit couldn't brook anything like that." He
caught Eliza's arm and hurried her pace. "We
go in the front way, please take notice!"</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">AN INTERRUPTED TEA</p>


<p>More bewildered every moment, Eliza hurried
along, obediently, and in a minute more found
herself in a paved yard on which faced a stable
built of stone similar to the fine house backing
upon it.</p>

<p>Phil threw open a side door and disclosed the
round, good-natured face of a man, leaning back
in a ragged Morris chair, his feet on a deal table.</p>

<p>"Hello, Pat. I've brought my best girl to
show her my room."</p>

<p>The Irishman sprang to his feet, and grinned
politely.</p>

<p>"They have old girls in New York," remarked
Eliza drily.</p>

<p>"Whativer age ye are, mum," said Pat
gallantly, "ye don't look it."</p>

<p>They passed him and ascended a narrow
stair. "This is cement, Mr. Sidney," said
Eliza, "and probably no mice."</p>

<p>"That settles it, Pluto," remarked Phil.
"You for the island."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>He ushered his companion into a room,
empty but for a deal table and chair, an oil
stove with a saucepan on it, and a couple of
piles of Indian blankets, two of which were
spread on the floor in place of rugs. One end of
the table was piled with sketches.</p>

<p>"Well!" exclaimed Eliza. "Why did you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Because," interrupted Phil laconically, and
pointed to a double window facing north.</p>

<p>"Take off your things, Eliza," he added
joyously, beginning to unbutton her coat.</p>

<p>"There were no horses that I saw," said the
bewildered visitor.</p>

<p>"Family in Europe," returned Phil.</p>

<p>"But it's warm and comfortable."</p>

<p>"Have to keep fires on account of the plumbing.
The coachman was a family man before
master and mistress departed, and they kept
house in two rooms up here. I have succeeded
to Mrs. Maloney's kitchen. Behold the running
water. The other room is used for storage.
Being single, Pat got the job of caretaker and
sleeps downstairs. Can you suggest an improvement?"</p>

<p>If Eliza had thought Phil handsome before,
she stared now at the illumination of his triumphant
face as his eyes questioned her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>She smiled, and there was a protesting
scramble in the basket.</p>

<p>"Come out, Katze, of course," said the host,
and, stooping, released the prisoner.</p>

<p>Pluto leaped forth and made a tour of the
room, smelling daintily of the blankets.</p>

<p>"Of course, when I get Aunt Mary's things,
you know," continued Phil.</p>

<p>"I wish they'd come," said Eliza, dazed and
smiling. "I'd like to see how they're goin' to
look."</p>

<p>"They'll be here before you leave. Now,
take the Turkish armchair, Miss Brewster, and
loll back while I talk to you; and pretty soon
we'll have some tea."</p>

<p>As he spoke the host doubled a striped blanket
over the kitchen chair and deposited Eliza.
She felt dumb in the change from dismal loneliness
to this atmosphere charged with vitality.</p>

<p>Phil threw himself on the blanket at her
feet, and leaning on one elbow looked up into
the eyes which wandered about the plastered
room.</p>

<p>"Made to order, Eliza, made to order," he
assured her. "No one but Mrs. Fabian knows
where I am, and she's not likely to interrupt
me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>"Stables ain't just in her line," said Eliza.
"I was afraid, comin' up the street, that she had
led you into extravagance."</p>

<p>"Oh, she is very kind," laughed Phil. "She
was appalled when I told her what I had found,
and seemed to think my oil stove the most
pathetic thing in the world."</p>

<p>"Yes," remarked Eliza. "Her son Edgar'd
find some trouble livin' this way."</p>

<p>"I haven't met him yet."</p>

<p>"Nor Miss Kathleen?"</p>

<p>"No, she's at school, you know. Mrs. Fabian
has been very good to me. No one could be
kinder, and I'm afraid I've been a rather absent-minded
guest, but getting started has been
so glorious. Eliza, I'm the most fortunate
fellow in the world. Just think! Even no paper
on these walls!"</p>

<p>Eliza looked with disfavor at the rough
greyish plaster.</p>

<p>"'Twould be more cheerful with some real
pretty pattern," she said.</p>

<p>Phil laughed and caught Pluto by the back of
the neck as he was passing, and lifted him over
into the hollow of his arm.</p>

<p>"I like it this way," he explained.</p>

<p>Eliza looked down at him admiringly. "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
wish Mrs. Ballard could see you now," she
said.</p>

<p>"I wish she knew what she has done for me.
It seems as if this is the first time since my
childhood that I have known peace."</p>

<p>At the word there came a sound of voices
from below.</p>

<p>"The expressman!" exclaimed Phil, and
springing to his feet opened the door.</p>

<p>"Sure; go right up," they heard in Pat's rich
brogue.</p>

<p>"I'd better help him," said Phil, and went to
the head of the stair.</p>

<p>What met his astonished gaze was a large
black velvet hat ascending. It was willowy with
drooping feathers, and in the dimness of the
narrow stair it eclipsed the motive power which
was lifting it. In his amazement Philip stepped
back and presently met a slender face whose
dark eyes were lifted to his.</p>

<p>"We're taking you by storm, Mr. Sidney,"
said a low, slow voice. "I hope it's not inconvenient."</p>

<p>Edgar followed close behind. "I tried to send
your man up ahead," he said stridently, "but
he seemed to think this sort of thing was all
right."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Philip stood back a pace further in actual
bewilderment, and Kathleen Fabian extended
her delicately gloved hand.</p>

<p>"We're the Fabians," she said, examining
her host with quick appraisement, and her
smile was alluring.</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Phil, recovering himself
and taking the hand. "Very kind of you, I'm
sure."</p>

<p>"If you think you're easy to find," said
Edgar as they greeted, "you're much mistaken.
Mother got it all wrong, as usual."</p>

<p>Philip took in at a glance the dapper form of
his visitor. He had not been insensible of Edgar's
neglect of him in the young man's own
home; and had decided that Eastern and Western
ideas of hospitality must differ with more
than the width of a continent.</p>

<p>"Very good of you, I'm sure, to stick to
it," he returned composedly. "Come into my
suite and overlook its shortcomings if you
can."</p>

<p>Eliza had risen, startled.</p>

<p>"I suppose you both know Eliza Brewster,"
continued Phil. "She made life comfortable
for Aunt Mary so many years."</p>

<p>Edgar Fabian jerked his blond head in Eliza's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
direction. "How do," he said; but the host's
tone and manner constrained Kathleen to
approach the grey-haired woman, and again
hold out the delicate hand.</p>

<p>"Was it you who made those good cookies
Aunt Mary used to give us?" she asked slowly,
looking curiously at Phil's guest.</p>

<p>Eliza allowed the white glove to take her
bony fingers a moment, then she stepped behind
the solitary chair and set it forward for the
visitor.</p>

<p>The girl would have accepted it, but Phil
interposed.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Eliza," he said good-humoredly.
"Miss Fabian can get chairs at home. I am
going to treat her with truly Oriental magnificence.
Try this, Miss Fabian." The host indicated
a pile of Indian blankets, and Kathleen
sank upon them.</p>

<p>Then Phil turned to Edgar, who reached to
the host's ear as he stood in high-chested
superiority looking about the apartment with
disfavor.</p>

<p>"The choice of soft spots is small," said Phil,
"but help yourself. There's room beside your
sister here."</p>

<p>Edgar moved to the pile of blankets and sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
down; while Phil dropped, Turkish fashion, at
Eliza's feet and faced them.</p>

<p>"What a splendid cat!" said Kathleen.</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Phil. "Come here, Katze, and
see the lady." He seized Pluto and handed him
over to Kathleen."</p>

<p>"Oh, get out," said Edgar. "I hate cats."</p>

<p>His sister moved Pluto over to her other side
where he drove his claws into the blanket with
satisfaction while she caressed him.</p>

<p>"He'll soil your glove," said Eliza; "his hair
comes out some." She resented the Fabian
touch on her pet, and Edgar's remark had sent
color to her sallow cheeks.</p>

<p>"I'd like a muff made of him," drawled
Kathleen.</p>

<p>"Too late," said Phil. "He's going to Maine
to-night with Eliza."</p>

<p>"He isn't your cat, then?" said the girl, and
brushed her glove.</p>

<p>"No, Eliza refuses to give him to me."</p>

<p>"There's that oil stove," remarked Edgar.
"I don't know what there is so particularly
virtuous about an oil stove; but mother throws
yours at me every time we have an argument."</p>

<p>Philip regarded the speaker speculatively.
Edgar's voice had an arrogant quality, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
gave no idea of its beauty when he broke into
song. "I'd give you a glimpse of its virtues if
the expressman would come," replied the host.
He smiled up at Eliza while Kathleen watched
him. "Did you put in cups enough for all of
us?"</p>

<p>"Six cups and saucers," returned Eliza, "and
six plates, and six knives and forks, and six
spoons. I gave you the plated ones 'cause then
you wouldn't care if they were stolen."</p>

<p>"But I should care," returned Phil gravely.
"I shall search every departing guest."</p>

<p>"Indian blankets," said Edgar. "They suggest
the pipe of peace. Let's make it a cigarette."
He took out his case.</p>

<p>"Only one room here," remarked Phil.
"Perhaps the ladies object."</p>

<p>Edgar grinned at his sister. "Do you object
to a cigarette, Kath?" he asked, offering her the
open case.</p>

<p>"Perhaps Mr. Sidney is not a smoker," she
said, "and it would be unsociable."</p>

<p>The same curiosity which had grown in
Phil's eyes as he regarded young Fabian, now
stole into them as they met Kathleen's.</p>

<p>"I'm almost sure Eliza doesn't indulge,"
said the host, "and perhaps she doesn't like it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't think of me, Mr. Philip," exclaimed
Eliza hastily. "This is your house."</p>

<p>"My stable, you mean." He smiled. "No,
it's yours this afternoon, Eliza. You're to give
orders."</p>

<p>"Then you may smoke to your hearts' content,"
she responded promptly; and she sent an
inimical look toward the graceful girl in the
drooping hat. Let her smoke! Eliza hoped she
would, and let Philip Sidney see what the
Fabians were.</p>

<p>"Remove my sister's scruples, won't you,
Sidney?" said Edgar, offering his case.</p>

<p>Phil took a cigarette, and Edgar passed them
back to Kathleen.</p>

<p>"No, thanks," she replied. She had seen the
cool curiosity in the host's eyes as they rested
upon her a moment ago.</p>

<p>"Oh, go ahead," urged Edgar.</p>

<p>"I don't like your cigarettes," she returned
shortly, annoyed by his persistence. A deep
color grew in her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Wait till you know Kath better," said
Edgar with a wink toward Philip. "You'll
welcome any little human touches about her.
She's at the most painful stage of her college
career where she knows everything; and she's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
one of these high-brows; saves money&mdash;good
money&mdash;and buys microscopes with it!"
The utter scorn of the speaker's tone, as he
offered Phil a light, caused the latter to smile.</p>

<p>"What are you doing with a microscope,
Miss Fabian?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Hunting for an honest man," she returned
in her lingering speech.</p>

<p>"Stung!" remarked her brother. "Say, I
don't see any symptoms of painting up here,"
he added, looking around.</p>

<p>"No; you'll have to come down to the academy
to see the works of art I'm throwing off,"
said Phil. "I've been there two days."</p>

<p>Now there was another stir belowstairs and
this time it really was the expressman; and
Philip's effects began to come upstairs.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid we're dreadfully in the way,"
said Kathleen; while Edgar held his cigarette
between two fingers and moved about, watching
the invasion of barrels, boxes, and bedstead,
uncertain whether to lend a hand. "Aunt
Mary's old duds, as I'm alive!" he thought,
seeing Eliza's anxious supervision of each piece
as Phil came carrying it in.</p>

<p>"A great way to entertain you, Miss Fabian,"
said the host brightly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>"What can I do?" inquired Edgar perfunctorily,
continuing to get in Phil's way with the
assiduity of a second Marcelline.</p>

<p>"If you won't mind being put on the shelf for
a minute," said Phil, tired of avoiding him,
"I'm going to tote in one more and then we're
done." And picking up the astonished Edgar he
set him on a barrel which had been placed in
a corner, and so succeeded in bringing in the
heaviest of the boxes undisturbed.</p>

<p>Edgar, very red in the face, swung his patent
leather feet for a minute and then jumped down.
"We must be going, Kath," he said stiffly.</p>

<p>"Not till you've found the mahl-stick," she
drawled, with stars in her eyes. "My brother is
so curious about your painting implements,
Mr. Sidney."</p>

<p>"They're in these boxes," responded Phil.
"The very ones that dear little Aunt Mary
used."</p>

<p>He had paid the expressman and was pulling
down his cuffs. His guests were both standing.</p>

<p>"Personally," he continued, "I think the
contents of the barrel more interesting just
now. You mustn't go without a cup of tea.
One moment and I'll make a raid on Pat for a
hammer."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>Phil left the room and Edgar still stood,
quite flushed under his sister's smile.</p>

<p>"Do you want any tea?" he asked severely.</p>

<p>"I think I do," replied Kathleen.</p>

<p>"I'll send the car back for you, then."</p>

<p>"Not at all," she answered; and when the
girl's voice took this tone and her eyes narrowed,
her brother usually paid attention.
After all, Kathleen was a useful court of last
appeal. It was unwise to offend her.</p>

<p>"What's the matter? Eliza can chaperone
you," he protested.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with Phil's disappearance
Eliza had moved to the window and looked
out on the advancing twilight. She heard the
words, and her thin lips tightened.</p>

<p>"That's the very cat that assaulted and
battered mother," went on Edgar, and although
he lowered his voice Eliza heard the words and
smiled grimly at a neighboring stable.</p>

<p>Kathleen frowned and motioned with her
head toward the black alpaca back.</p>

<p>Edgar shrugged his immaculate shoulders.</p>

<p>"Well, tell me when you have had enough of
it," he said, and threw himself back on the pile
of blankets.</p>

<p>Kathleen was just planning some civil over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>ture
to Eliza when the host reappeared, a
hatchet in his hand.</p>

<p>"That bold son of Erin dares to imply that
I borrowed his hammer yesterday," he announced.
"If I did, it is in Mrs. Maloney's
closet; and if there it is as a needle in a haystack;
for that closet, Miss Fabian, is responsible
for the air of chaste elegance you observe
in this apartment. If you'll all stand aside, not
to be bombarded when I open the door, I will
give one glimpse within."</p>

<p>Phil opened the closet door cautiously, and
deftly caught a mandolin as it bounded forth.</p>

<p>"Sole relic of glee-club days," he remarked.
"I don't know why I brought it, for I couldn't
play 'Yankee Doodle' on it now."</p>

<p>He delved further into the closet, and Edgar,
picking up the mandolin as one friend in a
strange land, removed it from its case with slow
and condescending touch.</p>

<p>"Here's the hammer on the sink," said Eliza
suddenly.</p>

<p>"Saved!" exclaimed Phil, pushing back billowing
folds of grey. "I was just about losing in
a combat with a bath-wrapper. Now, with these
chairs and the hammer, what is to prevent our
salon from being the most delightful success?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nothing!" exclaimed Kathleen, standing at
the end of the table. "I have found some
sketches, Mr. Sidney. May I look at them?"</p>

<p>"Certainly." The artist took the hammer
and began an attack on the barrel which caused
Edgar to raise his eyebrows in annoyance.
He was testing the strings of the mandolin.</p>

<p>"Shall I light the stove?" asked Eliza.</p>

<p>"No, you're the guest of honor. Sit down,
Eliza, and watch us. Mr. Fabian will light the
stove."</p>

<p>"Heaven forbid," exclaimed Edgar devoutly,
"that I should touch the enemy of my
peace!"</p>

<p>Kathleen, her lip caught between her teeth
as she turned the sketches with concentrated
interest, sent an ironical glance toward her
brother, strumming the mandolin on the
blanket couch.</p>

<p>"Yes, you're elected, Fabian," said Phil,
deftly removing the barrel-hoop. "You have
the matches. You see the peace and calm on
my brow? That is because I am serene in the
knowledge of a lemon and a bag of sugar outside
on the window ledge."</p>

<p>Reluctantly Edgar laid down the mandolin
and approached the stove.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you do?" he asked superciliously.
"Turn on something at the bottom, and light it
at the top?"</p>

<p>"Edgar," warned his sister, "it isn't gas."</p>

<p>"Marrow-bones, Fabian, get down on them,"
said Phil good-humoredly; and disgustedly
Edgar knelt to his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bte noir</i>.</p>

<p>Eliza's fingers itched to help him. She obeyed
Phil's warning gestures to keep her seat until
the match was finally applied to the wicks.
Then, seeing that they were turned too high,
she pounced down on the floor beside the young
man, and pushing his immaculate arm away
she lowered the wicks.</p>

<p>Edgar stared at the familiarity. "Excuse
me," she said shortly.</p>

<p>"Must have a finger in the pie, eh?" remarked
Phil.</p>

<p>"Do you know how long it'd take to get this
room so full o' soot we couldn't stay in it?"
asked Eliza. "I wonder what sort of a mess
you're goin' to live in here, Mr. Sidney, if you
don't know that?"</p>

<p>"It's a smokeless one," protested Phil
meekly.</p>

<p>"The cat's foot!" quoth Eliza scornfully.
"Don't tell me! There's no such thing." She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
partly filled the kettle and placed it on the
stove, watching the wicks with a jealous eye.</p>

<p>Edgar removed himself from danger and
looked with exasperation at Kathleen, who with
eyes aglow was turning the sketches.</p>

<p>"If I ever worked as hard for tea as this I'll
be hung!" he thought, and returned to the
mandolin as the one congenial object in a forlorn
abode.</p>

<p>Even its long silent strings spoke plaintively
against the vulgar banging which was removing
the barrel-head.</p>

<p>"There!" exclaimed Phil presently. "I
rather fancy the way I did that. I can use
that barrel again."</p>

<p>"Yes," assented Edgar as he strummed,
"for kindlings for the oil-stove."</p>

<p>Phil drew the barrel nearer the table.</p>

<p>"Now for the plums in the pudding," he said,
and began to draw forth some papered cups
from the excelsior.</p>

<p>Kathleen dropped the sketches and unwrapped
the packages. She had stood three
cups and saucers on the table before Eliza
turned from her labors about the stove.</p>

<p>"What delightful old things!" exclaimed
the girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, aren't you glad you stayed?" asked
Phil, bringing forth a silver cream pitcher of
long ago.</p>

<p>Eliza caught sight of the table, and suddenly
threw up both hands with an exclamation.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sidney!" she cried. "I've given you
the wrong barrel!"</p>

<p>"What? What's happened?" inquired Phil,
halted by her tragic tone.</p>

<p>"All Mrs. Ballard's best things are in that
barrel; the old china that was her mother's,
and the solid silver, and everything; and I've
gone and sent yours with the substantial
crockery and the beddin' to the island!"</p>

<p>Edgar Fabian regarded Eliza as inimically as
his stepmother might have done. So this old
servant had been carrying off the heirlooms
and been discovered.</p>

<p>He sat up very straight on his blanket couch.</p>

<p>"I'll speak to my mother," he said. "She can
come over to-morrow and get them, and buy
the right sort of thing for a bachelor"&mdash;he
threw a glance around the plastered room&mdash;"apartment!"</p>

<p>Phil, not realizing the sensitiveness of the
subject, laughed.</p>

<p>"Good work, Eliza! We'll have one aristo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>cratic
tea in the Sidney studio, before we fall to
stone china and mugs."</p>

<p>"The others ain't stone china and mugs,"
cried Eliza. She was trembling from head to
foot, as frightened and enraged by Edgar's suggestion
as if her own life had been at stake.
"They're all good, comfortable things. If it
was safe I'd leave all these for you, Mr. Philip,
just as liefs to as not, for she loved you; but
you are gone all day; they'd be stole&mdash;just as
Mr. Fabian says."</p>

<p>Edgar blinked, then his face grew scarlet as
the servant's implication grew upon him.</p>

<p>"What do you mean&mdash;you&mdash;!"</p>

<p>He leaped to his feet and faced Eliza, who
glared back at him. "These things should belong
to my mother," he said, "and it's a good
thing you didn't succeed in getting away with
them. She may set some value on the old stuff.
I don't know."</p>

<p>"Edgar!" exclaimed Kathleen, as scarlet as
he, while the duel had all happened so suddenly
that the host stared, dazed.</p>

<p>He had just lifted another silver piece from
the barrel and taken it from its flannel bag.</p>

<p>"They do not belong to your mother," returned
Eliza angrily. "They belong to me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
to have and to hold, or to give away as I see
fit."</p>

<p>Edgar shrugged. "Oh, in that case&mdash;" he
returned. He didn't like Eliza's eyes.</p>

<p>"In that case," said Phil to him gravely, "I
think you'll feel better to apologize to the
woman who has put Aunt Mary's relatives
under lifelong obligation for her devoted care."</p>

<p>Edgar tossed his head with a scornful
grimace.</p>

<p>"Yes, I understand perfectly," went on Phil,
coloring; "Aunt Mary was no kin to you, and
I understand that she was a person held in little
consideration by your family." The host's
attitude was tense now, and his look compelling.
"Nevertheless, Eliza Brewster happens
to be my honored guest to-day, and I'm sure
you will be glad to express your regret for your
choice of words."</p>

<p>"Edgar, you didn't understand," said Kathleen.
"Say so. Why, of course, you're glad
to say so."</p>

<p>"No, I didn't understand," remarked Edgar
with a languid air, strumming the mandolin,
"and now that I do, I don't know that it is very
interesting."</p>

<p>Phil saw Kathleen's acute distress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very sorry, I'm sure," continued the young
man, nodding toward Eliza. "You can run
away with your barrel and welcome. The Fabians
will still have cups and saucers. I think,"
returning Phil's grave gaze contemptuously,
"if your honored guest should apologize for
her attack on my mother, it would be quite as
much to the point. You heard her say that
mother would come over and steal her trash,
didn't you? Come, Kathleen." The speaker
dropped the mandolin, squared his shoulders,
and started for the door.</p>

<p>"No; oh, no!" exclaimed Phil, all his hearty
Western hospitality in arms at the sight of his
girl guest's expression.</p>

<p>Edgar turned on him again. "I fancied that
my mother had been rather civil to you since
your arrival. I'll tell her how you guard her
dignity."</p>

<p>Edgar was fairly swelling with emotion, one
fourth of which was indignant defence of his
mother, and three fourths joy at a clear case
against the poverty-stricken artist who had
dared set his own sacred person on a barrel and
make him light an oil-stove.</p>

<p>Kathleen's scarlet face and lambent eyes
spoke her distress. Phil, faced with condoning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the slur on his kind hostess, was bewildered and
uncertain.</p>

<p>Eliza saw it all and was the most disturbed
of the four.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Fabian, it's all my fault!" she exclaimed,
looking appealingly at Edgar. "Please
stay for tea."</p>

<p>"Really, you know," said Phil, "this is all a
tempest in a tea-pot." He held up Aunt Mary's
graceful old-colonial silver. "This one would
be too big to hold it."</p>

<p>"Come, Kath," said Edgar, ignoring them.
"Will you come with me or shall I wait for you
in the car?"</p>

<p>Kathleen gave him an imploring look, but he
was already moving to the door.</p>

<p>Phil took an impulsive step toward her.
"Perhaps you will stay," he said, in supreme
discomfort. She gave him a little smile. "No,
I mustn't," she answered gently. "I'm sorry I
hadn't finished looking at the sketches."</p>

<p>"May I bring them over to you?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I go back to school in
the morning. Good-bye, I wish you all success."</p>

<p>Eliza stood with tight-clasped hands. It had
been her fault that the bud of an acquaintance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
which might have been serviceable to her young
friend had been blighted. They would tell Mrs.
Fabian. She might visit her anger upon him.
Eliza had never expected to feel gratitude
toward one of the name, but her surprise was
mingled with that sentiment when Kathleen
now approached her, laying her smooth gloved
hand on the rough clasped ones to say good-bye.</p>

<p>"You are going to Brewster's Island?" she
asked. "It is a strange time of year."</p>

<p>"'Twas my home once," replied Eliza,
tragedy of past and present so evident in her
haggard face that a touch of pity stirred the
girl's heart.</p>

<p>"I heard," said Kathleen, "that Mrs. Wright
is staying there. How can she in the desolate
winter?"</p>

<p>"I guess angels can live anywhere," responded
Eliza. Her disturbed eyes met Kathleen's.
"Miss Fabian," and her hard hand
grasped the gloved one, "I don't care how cold
the winter's goin' to be if only you'll promise
me that I haven't done any harm to this boy
here by my foolish talk. He ain't to blame if I
seemed to&mdash;to speak about your mother.
Don't, don't let her blame him for it. If I
thought she would&mdash;if I thought I'd cut him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
off from friends&mdash;some day when I get to
thinkin' about it up there on that hill I feel as if
I should jump into the water and done with it."</p>

<p>"I'll explain," said Kathleen gently. "I
hope you'll have a good winter. I'm glad you
will have Mrs. Wright."</p>

<p>When the girl turned back, Edgar had gone;
and the veil of perfunctoriness had fled from her
host's eyes. He was looking at her as friend at
friend.</p>

<p>He escorted her downstairs, and out through
the alley to the waiting limousine within
which, with elevated feet, Edgar was already
solacing himself with a cigarette. At sight of
the approaching pair, he leaped from the car,
and received his sister with hauteur.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," said Phil composedly, when
they were inside; "very good of you to come."</p>

<p>He closed the door, the machine started, and
he returned to the stable, where Pat received
him with a grin, still standing where he had
risen when Kathleen passed through a minute
ago. "I say, me bye," he said huskily, jerking
his thumb in the direction of the stairway, "the
auld one above there&mdash;she's yer second best
girl, I'm thinkin'. That one," pointing to the
street, "she do be a princess all roight. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
turned them lamps on me when she first come
in and asked for you, and I felt chape 'cause the
stairs wasn't marble; but look out, me son, I
know that breed. She'll make ye toe the mark."</p>

<p>Phil smiled. "To be honest with you, Pat,
I have just one best girl," he said emphatically.</p>

<p>Pat looked up at him with admiration.</p>

<p>"Is she in New York, thin?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes I think I shall get a glimpse of
her here."</p>

<p>"Sure if she knows where ye are ye will,
thin!" said Pat devoutly. "How does she dress
so I'll know her? I'll be on the watch."</p>

<p>"Just now in scarlet and gold," said Phil,
lifting his head and gazing beyond the stable
wall.</p>

<p>"Faith, she knows a thing or two," nodded
Pat. "'Tis an old dodge, 'Red and Yeller,
ketch a feller.'"</p>

<p>"In winter she goes all in white," said Phil,
"soft, pure, spotless."</p>

<p>"Moighty wasteful fer the city!" said Pat
seriously. " 'Twill be hard on yer pocket, me
bye."</p>

<p>"In spring she's in golden-green among the
browns, but in summer, full, glorious green,
Pat. Oh, she's a wonderful girl, a goddess!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sure she is if she knows that green's the
best of all the game," exclaimed the Irishman.
"Whin'll she be comin'?"</p>

<p>"Ah, I have to go to her, Pat."</p>

<p>"'Tis better so," agreed the other.</p>

<p>"I've thought she might meet me sometime
out in the park."</p>

<p>"She can, sir." Pat gave Phil's shoulder a
sounding slap.</p>

<p>"But I notice the park gate is kept locked."</p>

<p>"It is," agreed Pat, with shining face, "and
'tis meself has a key. 'Twill be yours for the
askin' any day in the week."</p>

<p>"Great!" responded Phil. "I'll remember
that."</p>

<p>"And sure I'll be lookin'," thought Pat,
watching the artist take the stairway in bounds.
"The women'll mob that bye afore he gets
through. Sure I'd like to see the gurl brings
that look to his eyes."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">HEIRLOOMS</p>


<p>As the Fabian car started toward home, Edgar
hoped his sister would rally him on his failure to
chastise the puny artist from the West. Anything
was better than one of Kathleen's "stills,"
as he called his sister's periods of scornful
silence. He was Kathleen's elder, he was her
brother. By every law of propriety she should
be guided by him and lean upon his opinions;
but as he now reflected she was "more apt to
jump on them."</p>

<p>At present her sombre eyes looked straight
ahead under the picture hat, and her countenance
expressed only composure of mind and
body. He had thrown away his cigarette, and
he began to hum the favorite aria from "Madam
Butterfly." Kathleen, if she spoke at all,
would probably try to persuade him to say
nothing to their mother of the scene just passed.
He would offer her an opening for speech. Perhaps
she was anxious in spite of her acted
composure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>"I heard 'Butterfly' last week," he said.
"Farrar can have me."</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>"Well," he looked around at the slender dark
face with the eyes full of slumberous fire.
"Well, why don't you get off one of those juices
of yours about the fair Geraldine probably not
being aware of her good luck, et cetera?"</p>

<p>The chauffeur was playing with the speed
limit. They would soon be at home. Kathleen
realized that this would be the only opportunity
to speak with her brother alone.</p>

<p>She slowly turned her head and met his
quickly averted gaze. "You are not usually so
chivalrous toward mother," she said. "Why did
you think it worth while to make such a fuss?"</p>

<p>"Twitting on facts is bad taste," declared
Edgar with his usual air of insouciance. If
his sister would only talk, all would be well.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"Why, Aunt Mary's faithful retainer showed
the poorest possible taste. She said if mother
knew that those antiques were left unprotected
by anything but the oil-stove, she would
prance over to that stable and nab them."</p>

<p>Kathleen stared at him. "Do you mean that
she would?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>"Like a shot," responded Edgar cheerfully.
"Wasn't I bound to resent it?"</p>

<p>Kathleen kept silence a space. Since she had
been at home this time, her mother had told her
with some excitement of Eliza's presumption in
retaining articles of no value to a servant.</p>

<p>"And whether I was warranted or not," went
on Edgar, elated by her muteness, "'there
comes an opportunity in the lives of men'
which seldom knocks on a man's door the second
time. I flatter myself I was quick enough
to shut the box between that wild and woolly
Westerner and us, so that he won't expect anything
more of <em>me</em>, in any event."</p>

<p>"I should think not," returned Kathleen
slowly. "The childish way you took your playthings
and went home was ridiculous."</p>

<p>Edgar's face flamed. "Don't be nasty, Kathleen,
just because you know how," he said,
dropping his careless tone. "No doubt you
thought it was very funny to see me lifted about
like a doll, and on my knees lighting a stove. I
went there to please you, but I can tell you a
very little of alleys and stables will do for me.
When I go slumming it'll be where the poor
know their place and know mine."</p>

<p>"Oh, Edgar," said Kathleen hopelessly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
"Well, is it your intention to tell mother what
happened?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to keep that up my sleeve. It
may come in handy sometime."</p>

<p>"It would hurt her feelings, and do no good,"
said the girl.</p>

<p>"Do no good? What! Not if it kept her from
inviting the cowboy early and often to the
house? Oh, yes, I've no doubt he's got you all
right. He's a looker, and girls are all alike."</p>

<p>Kathleen did not condescend to notice this
thrust. Her eyes turned back to gaze upon the
road as it flew beneath their car. "Don't lie
awake planning to avoid Mr. Sidney," she said
quietly. "He will probably always see you first;
but from the moment you tell mother about
this petty little scene we've just passed through,
you need never come to me for assistance in any
line. I shall not give it to you."</p>

<p>Stealing a side glance at his sister's face,
Edgar Fabian knew that she meant what she
said.</p>

<p>"Supposing," she went on presently, "that
you had smoothed over an awkward moment,
and that we had had tea in Aunt Mary's egg-shell
cups, and had let that brave fellow think
he was giving us pleasure, and that you had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
sung something to his mandolin in your charming
voice;&mdash;think of the difference in situation
to us all. Instead of four hurt people, scattering,
and feeling awkward and ashamed, we
should have given the stranger in a strange
land a little housewarming to begin life with
here."</p>

<p>"Not four hurt people, if you please," retorted
Edgar with bravado; but he was surprised,
and somewhat affected by his sister's
picture. His charming voice would doubtless
have increased the host's respect for him.</p>

<p>"I expect sometime, of course," he went on
with a superior air, "to be a patron of the arts
to a certain extent. If the cowboy makes good,
and learns to keep his hands off his betters, I
may do something for him yet."</p>

<p>Kathleen's risibles were not easily stirred;
but now she laughed low, and so heartily that
Edgar's inflation over her compliment to his
voice became as a pricked balloon. She even
wiped away a tear as she ceased.</p>

<p>"Philip Sidney is going to interest the patrons
of art," she said at last.</p>

<p>"What makes you so sure?" asked Edgar
with a sneer. "His physique?"</p>

<p>"His sketches, his superiority to his circum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>stances,
and his behavior to Eliza," returned
Kathleen composedly.</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" exclaimed her brother. "I'd
like to see myself saddled with that gargoyle
and a wild-cat, in an unfurnished stable on a
dismal afternoon."</p>

<p>"Yes, you've shown your sympathy and
assistance in a manly and powerful manner,"
said Kathleen, as the car stopped before the
brown-stone front of their home.</p>

<p>"Sarcasm, Miss Fabian," returned her brother,
as he assisted her to alight, "is the cheapest
and meanest of weapons. Each one to his
taste. That state of things suited him. It
wouldn't suit me. That's all. It takes all
sorts of people to make the world."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian was in the drawing-room, and as
her children entered she looked up expectantly,
then her face fell.</p>

<p>"I told you to bring Phil back with you to
tea."</p>

<p>"I forgot it, mother, really," said Kathleen.
She sat down and began taking off her gloves.
"But he couldn't have come."</p>

<p>"No," added Edgar. "He had a guest;
your friend Eliza Brewster was there with her
cat."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>"Eliza!" echoed Mrs. Fabian, sitting up. "Is
she going to cook for Philip?"</p>

<p>"No," said Kathleen. "She is going to
Brewster's Island to-night."</p>

<p>"I tried," added Edgar, "to get her to send
you the cat as a souvenir, but she refused."</p>

<p>"I'm glad she is leaving town," said Mrs.
Fabian. "She is a very ungrateful person and I
detest ingratitude. Moreover, a person who is
in an anomalous position is always annoying,
and Aunt Mary made Eliza so much a member
of her family that the woman doesn't know her
place. What was she doing over at Phil's?"</p>

<p>"Overseeing the moving in of Aunt Mary's
dunnage," replied Edgar.</p>

<p>"Why! Has he more than one room?" asked
Mrs. Fabian with interest.</p>

<p>"No, mother," said Kathleen, in a tone designed
to offset Edgar's sprightly scorn. "He
has just one, and nothing in it but piles of
Indian blankets and a table and chair."</p>

<p>"The chair for Eliza, mind you," put in
Edgar, "while Kathleen and I were stowed on
the floor."</p>

<p>A spark glowed in the girl's eyes as she regarded
her brother. "He let you sit on a barrel,
I remember," she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, yes," returned Edgar; "and speaking of
barrels," he went on, a belligerent spark glowing
in his eyes, "a ripping thing happened.
All this old stuff came over while we were there,
and among them a barrel of dishes. Well, Sidney
opened it and began taking out the things,
but instead of the coarse stuff Eliza had meant
to give him, there were gold-banded china, and
colonial silver tea-things&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian's backbone suddenly seemed of
steel. "Aunt Mary had a few fine old things,"
she interrupted.</p>

<p>"Well, there they were. She'd given Sidney
the wrong barrel. You should have seen her
face. She was ready to faint."</p>

<p>"You say she leaves to-night?" Mrs.
Fabian's eyes were looking far away through
the wall of her house toward Gramercy Park.
"Philip won't want the care of those delicate
old things," she added. "I'll get some proper
ones for him in the morning."</p>

<p>Edgar laughed gleefully, none the less that
Kathleen's lips were grave.</p>

<p>"If I were you, mother," said the girl, "I
would let them work it out. Eliza seems to
have taken the helm over there."</p>

<p>"Of course she has," agreed Mrs. Fabian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
sharply. "Taking is Eliza's forte. That china
and silver belonged to my grandmother. If
Aunt Mary didn't have enough thoughtfulness
to leave it to me in writing, is that any reason
it should not be mine?"</p>

<p>"Aunt Mary knew," said Kathleen, "that
you had everything you wanted."</p>

<p>"Everything I needed, perhaps," retorted
Mrs. Fabian, with excitement, "but I certainly
want my own grandmother's things; and Providence
has thrown them into my hands. I shall
explain everything to Philip and he will be glad
to have me take them. Isn't he all that I said
he was, Kathleen?"</p>

<p>"He is very interesting," returned Kathleen
quietly.</p>

<p>Then she rose and went to the door. Edgar
followed her uneasily to the foot of the stairs.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to peach, Kath, don't worry,"
he said. "I'll keep the compact. I just wanted
to prove to you that I knew the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mater</i>."</p>

<p>His sister turned on him. "I told you that
you should have been the girl and I the man,"
she said; and he winced under the contempt of
her look. "If mother gets those things to-morrow,
the result for you will be just what I
promised. I shall never be at your call again."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>"You said&mdash;" began Edgar, perturbed.</p>

<p>But Kathleen ran swiftly upstairs. Her
brother returned to the drawing-room.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with Kathleen?" inquired
Mrs. Fabian. "She behaved so
strangely."</p>

<p>"Oh," returned Edgar, shaking his head as if
exasperated beyond patience, "Kath's a stiff.
She can't see a joke if she runs into it. Now, I
think that barrel business was funny, don't
you?"</p>

<p>"It's something more than funny," returned
Mrs. Fabian impressively. "It's Providence,
as I said."</p>

<p>"Well, now, I'll wager," declared her son
argumentatively, "that if you take the law
into your own hands and bring that old truck
over here, Kathleen will cut us both."</p>

<p>"What in the world is the reason? Was she
so impressed with Philip? I think he's irresistible
myself, but Kathleen is so unimpressionable&mdash;and
beside, he won't disapprove."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure. He treats Eliza as if she
was the one best bet. I don't pretend to know
all Kath thinks. She's a high-brow and a crank.
Do you suppose she'd look at a man unless he
was a college professor? I guess not."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't speak of your sister so, Edgar. You
have reason to be grateful that she is not an
ordinary silly flirt."</p>

<p>"Flirt!" ejaculated Edgar, with rolling eyes.
"Do you suppose she'd sit on the stairs with
anything but a Latin book, or flirt with anything
but a microscope?"</p>

<p>"Well, then, you don't have to worry about
her?"</p>

<p>"Don't I!" retorted Edgar laconically.</p>

<p>"I must say," pursued Mrs. Fabian virtuously,
"it is too much for Kathleen always to
expect me to hold her judgment superior to
mine. I shall do in this matter what I see fit."</p>

<p>"Then it's all up with me," observed Edgar.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"She'll visit it on me. She always does."
Edgar was beginning to wish that he had not
played with fire. "Beside, in this case, Eliza
says that old stuff belongs to her; is hers to do
as she pleases with."</p>

<p>"Yes," returned Mrs. Fabian, with righteous
indignation. "Possession is nine tenths of the
law; and if I get that possession we'll see what
the law can do for her!"</p>

<p>"Oh," protested Edgar petulantly, "why do
you want to bother with it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>His mother's eyes were glistening. In fancy
she saw the convenient barrel in which was
compactly stowed Aunt Mary's little store of
heirlooms.</p>

<p>"Because," she answered with dignity, "genuine
old things like that are not to be despised.
They would be just the thing at the
island."</p>

<p>"That's what Eliza thought," said Edgar
drily.</p>

<p>"The idea," exclaimed Mrs. Fabian, "of
her using such things in the sort of home she'll
have!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps she'll console Mrs. Wright with
them," said Edgar. "You were pitying her last
night for her winter exile."</p>

<p>"If she did, Mrs. Wright would give them
back to me at once," declared Mrs. Fabian;
"but never mind, there will be no need now.
Providence has thrown them right into my
hands. Occasionally you can see justice work
out in this world."</p>

<p>Edgar looked toward the portires. Kathleen
might return. There was no sign of any one
approaching, however.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm in wrong with Kath for having
spoken of it, then," he said. "Let me have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
twenty, will you, mother? You can afford to
on the strength of the heirlooms."</p>

<p>"I can't, Edgar."</p>

<p>"Ten, then; you owe me that much, I'm
sure."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian's lips took a tight line.</p>

<p>"You know, Edgar," she said impressively,
"your father has forbidden me to give you
money. He says you must learn the worth of
it."</p>

<p>The youth shrugged his shoulders impatiently,
and throwing himself into an easy-chair,
stretched his legs toward the blazing
logs and stared at the fire with the gloom of
one who feels that he has killed the goose
that laid the golden eggs. He had not, however,
told of Eliza's insult and his own wrathful
departure from the stable. He could defend
himself to Kathleen so far, when next
they met, and it might possibly soften her
heart.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Philip Sidney bounded up the stable
stairs, he came in upon Eliza, who was standing
as he had left her, and with such a woe-begone
expression that, meeting her tragical gaze, he
burst into a peal of laughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Philip, Mr. Philip!" she mourned.
"I've spoiled everything."</p>

<p>"What! Let the kettle boil over?"</p>

<p>"No, no; you'll make light of it for my sake;
but I've turned the Fabians against you! That
pert little bantam will go home and tell his
mother everything, and it'll make a lot o' difference.
They might have been lots o' use to you."</p>

<p>"Don't borrow trouble, Eliza. I'm not going
to have our last visit spoiled. I don't make use
of my friends anyway; and beside, I'm going to
be too busy to have any. Come, now, make the
tea. I want to see you drink so much that you
'swell wisibly before my wery eyes.' Shall we
use this fine old silver jug?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Sidney." Eliza wrung her hands.
"You're awful smart and strong; can we get
this barrel headed up again and off to the depot
to-night?"</p>

<p>"Why," Phil hesitated, "I suppose so, but
wouldn't you rather have your tea in comfort
now, before we go out to dinner, and let me do
the barrel to-morrow and send it off?"</p>

<p>"There wouldn't be any barrel," returned
Eliza darkly. "Not unless you packed and sent
it before you went to your school."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>"You heard me tell 'em right to their face,"
said Eliza.</p>

<p>"Oh, surely," protested Phil, "you don't
think Mrs. Fabian would do anything highhanded?"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't she, though?" returned Eliza.
"She hasn't got over it yet that Mrs. Ballard
sent your mother a diamond pin and didn't
leave her anything."</p>

<p>Phil looked puzzled. "Why didn't Aunt
Mary remember Aunt Isabel?" he asked.</p>

<p>"To tell the truth, I don't think Mrs.
Ballard meant to slight her. She just didn't
think anything about it. She knew Mrs. Fabian
was rich, and didn't suppose she'd care for
any of her little things. Your mother always
acted human toward her, and was her namesake,
and 'twas natural she should send her
something."</p>

<p>"Well, well; have a cup of tea anyway."
Eliza's pallor went to her host's heart. He
went to the window and brought in the lemon
and sugar.</p>

<p>Eliza followed him with her eyes.</p>

<p>"Do you think you can, Mr. Sidney?" she
asked, her hands interlocked.</p>

<p>"Can what?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do the barrel. I'll never forget it of you,"
she said fervently.</p>

<p>"I can't believe there's any necessity for
such haste. Pat's a good watch-dog so far as
thieves are concerned."</p>

<p>"You don't know what you're talking about,
Mr. Sidney. Trust me, it's my only chance
to save the dishes; and I tell you she might have
the whole kit and boodle of 'em and welcome, if
she'd been kind, or even decent to that little
angel. 'T ain't the silver and things I want.
It's to keep 'em away from her."</p>

<p>Phil could see that Eliza was trembling in her
intensity. She had shaken her head until she
had again loosened the grey locks about her
gaunt face.</p>

<p>"I don't care anything about anything to eat,
Mr. Sidney," she went on. "I can head up the
barrel myself in some kind of a way, but it's
got to go to the depot or else I don't, and my
berth's all paid for."</p>

<p>"How did you ever happen to be born in
New England?" returned Phil meditatively,
noting her clenched hands. "You and Bernhardt
would have been rivals. Settle down
comfortably now. Make the tea and I'll
head up the barrel after you have used one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
of these cups. If necessary, we'll ride on the
wagon."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Sidney, <em>can</em> we ride on the wagon?"
exclaimed Eliza in a frenzy of gratitude.</p>

<p>Phil laughed. "Anyway, the barrel shall
leave here to-night. I'll take one of my brushes
and do such high-art addressing that it will
follow you meekly to the island. Don't you
worry another moment. I guarantee it."</p>

<p>"Then it'll have to leave here before we do,"
persisted Eliza.</p>

<p>"It shall leave here before we do. Now, are
you satisfied?"</p>

<p>Eliza heaved a deep sigh of relief and proceeded
to make the tea.</p>

<p>Phil was inclined to be impatient with her
fears; but the next day, when he returned from
the Academy, Pat met him with a grin.</p>

<p>"Sure ye're the divil of a bye," he said with
an expansive gesture. "I'll have to put on a
biled shirt every day to resave yer company.
'T was no less than the Queen o' Sheby came to
see ye this mornin' an' you not gone tin
minutes."</p>

<p>"A lady&mdash;the one who was here yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Sure 't was no slip of a girl in a big hat to-day,
'T was a queen, I'm tellin' ye. She rolled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
up in her motor car an' come here an' knocked
on me door, an' me without a collar on. She
was dressed in furs an' looked like she owned
the earth.</p>

<p>"'I wish to see Mr. Sidney,' says she.</p>

<p>"'Thin ye'll have to go farther, mum,' says I.
'Ye'll find him at the paintin' school,' says I.</p>

<p>"She didn't need any paint herself, I'm
tellin' ye. She got rid in the face while she was
talkin'.</p>

<p>"'I'm his aunt,' says she, haughty-like, 'an'
as long as I'm here I'll see his room,' says she;
an' wid that she wint up them stairs like they
belonged to her. I heerd her movin' around, an'
I hurried to button me collar an' slick up.
Presently I dropped the comb, for I heerd her
comin' back. Before she'd got away downstairs,
'What have ye done wid the barrel?'
says she. 'What bar'l? ' says I. 'The wan Mr.
Sidney had here last night,' says she. Thin I
remembered there was wan. 'It moved out,'
says I, 'wid his company,' says I. 'What company?'
says she, and her eyes snapped the way
I expected to hear her say, 'Off with his head!'</p>

<p>"'A lady,' says I, 'wid a cat in a basket.
'T was a reg'lar movin',' says I.</p>

<p>"She bit her lip, and muttered: 'Just like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
her!' I heerd her plain, though she wasn't
lookin' at me no more. Take an auld man's
advice, me bye. Kape away from the Queen o'
Sheby for a while; an' if ye don't tell me what
was in that bar'l rollin' up an' down stairs like
a restless soul, I'll be havin' the nightmare,
sure."</p>

<p>Phil laughed, and shook his head. "The ways
of women, Pat," he said, "are so far beyond me
that I can't even guess."</p>

<p>"Can't guess what was in the bar'l? Tell me,
now, or ye'll not git the key to the park nor
meet yer sweetheart."</p>

<p>"There were dishes and silver in that barrel,
Pat. Each of the women thinks she owns
them."</p>

<p>"I'd bet on the Queen o' Sheby," said Pat.</p>

<p>"You'd lose, then," returned Phil, running
upstairs.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">THE ARRIVAL</p>


<p>Eliza Brewster reached Portland in time for
breakfast; and the hours she must spend before
the one afternoon boat started for the island
were embarrassing ones on account of Pluto.
She had a cup of coffee and an egg in the station,
and then lifted her heavy basket on the
car and rode across the city to the wharf.</p>

<p>Setting the cat at liberty she followed him
about, and held him on her lap, alternately,
until passengers were allowed to board the
steamer. The captain and purser were new to
her. She glanced about the cabin as she sat, her
arms clasped about the basket, out of whose
window Pluto's eyes were again glowering.
Eliza dreaded recognizing some one she knew;
but no recognition occurred, and she had ample
time in the two hours' ride to meditate on past
and future. Many years had fled since she last
saw Casco Bay. She and Mrs. Ballard had
spent a couple of weeks at Brewster's Island one
summer, but it had been their farewell to out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>ings
further from home than Coney Island.
She had not enjoyed the experience because of
wrathful resentment at the neglect of Mrs.
Fabian, then a bride; but Mrs. Ballard had
revelled in the natural beauty which feasted her
soul. Eliza evoked the memory now and smiled
grimly with satisfaction at the consideration
that the precious barrel was safely starting on
its journey after her.</p>

<p>She met her cat's green gaze through his
wire window. "If I set more value on my life
than I do, Pluto," she muttered, "I'd risk it
on Mrs. Fabian visitin' a certain stable this
mornin'. Then Mr. Philip'll know, and he'll
forgive me."</p>

<p>Her heart warmed as she thought of the jolly
kindness of her late host; of his assiduity and
care for her comfort; of the milk he had fed to
Pluto, and the hot beefsteak to herself.</p>

<p>"That supper last night cost him a lot o'
money. I know it did!" she thought remorsefully,
"but," with a revulsion of affectionate
concern, "I hope he'll eat good and not slight
himself when he's alone. There's such a lot of
him to nourish."</p>

<p>It was the sort of dismal weather which inspired
the description, "No sun, no moon, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
stars, November!" and Eliza dreaded the return
to her old changed home. Her heart beat
a little faster as the steamer ploughed along,
each minute bringing her nearer to that especial
hill rising from the waters of Casco Bay where
she first opened her eyes to life. Memories of
those dead and gone assailed her until her eyes
stung.</p>

<p>"I'd like to know," she thought sternly, "if
there's as ungrateful a critter in the universe.
S'posin' I was goin' to the island to nobody?
S'posin' I'd been seen off in New York by nobody?
That's what I'd expected to happen two
weeks ago."</p>

<p>Eliza gazed rebukingly at the steam radiator
in the middle of the cabin until her tears ceased.</p>

<p>She had not slept much in her unaccustomed
bed on the sleeping-car, impeded by the heavy
basket and her own hand-bag, and the fear of
how Pluto might behave at the stops; so the
boat ride seemed long, and it was with relief
that she at last heard the summons:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Brewster's Island. Land from the lower
deck."</p>

<p>"Praise be!" she thought. "I haven't got to
lug my things upstairs."</p>

<p>There were but few passengers to get off at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
this island, and but few persons standing in the
raw air on the wharf.</p>

<p>There was a lump in Eliza's throat as she
carried her burdens up the gangplank, but
through the mist in her eyes she saw a face she
recognized. It was lean, and smooth-shaven,
and had scarcely grown more lined in twenty
years. The man met her gaze with alert scrutiny
and then looked beyond her for some one.
The gangplank was drawn in.</p>

<p>"James," said Eliza, when she had swallowed.</p>

<p>The alert, searching eyes returned to her, and
looked, at first, without recognition.</p>

<p>"Don't tell me you don't know me, James,"
added the traveller, trying to laugh.</p>

<p>"Why, Eliza Brewster, I was runnin' over
ye," said the captain in hasty amazement.
"You&mdash;you've grown some spare, Eliza. Just
at first I didn't see who't wuz." The kindly
speaker endeavored to conceal his dismay.
"Amazin' how a little flesh off or on'll change a
body," he added. "Here, let me take your
bundles. Carriage right up here waitin' for us.
Mrs. Wright sent me down to meet ye. Kinder
homely day, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"That's a cat, James," said Eliza as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
seized the basket. "You see, I'm a real old
maid, travellin' with a cat."</p>

<p>"Well, it's all right, I s'pose," returned the
captain gallantly, as they walked up the wharf
toward the waiting carry-all; "but 't would 'a'
been more to the point if ye'd brought somethin'
that was kind of a rarity on the island. We
could 'a' supplied ye with a cat fer every day in
the week, black, white, malty, whatever ye
wanted. Well! how ye been, Eliza?"</p>

<p>"I guess you can see," returned Eliza laconically.</p>

<p>"Well, well," said Cap'n James. He helped
her into the carriage and followed. "Git ap,
Tom. Mrs. Wright'll fat ye up in no time. She
says you're goin' to stay with her."</p>

<p>"Yes, for a while I am." Eliza's eyes were
travelling over the familiar rolling landscape.
"How does she make out here?"</p>

<p>"Don't seem to complain none. Mr. Wright
has settled down like a round peg in a round
hole. Brewster's Island's good enough for
him."</p>

<p>"My, my! How it's changed!" murmured
Eliza as one unexpected roof after another rose
into view.</p>

<p>"I s'pose that's so," agreed Captain James.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
"You can't stay away even from one o' these
islands a dozen years or so without seein' the
foot o' man encroachin'. It's good fer trade,
Eliza, good fer trade. Lots o' the roofs ye see
cover empty cottages now, but come summer
time the place swarms all right. The Fabians
got enough room to swing a cat in. Nobody can
come very near them; but the rest o' the island's
pretty well dotted here and there."</p>

<p>"It don't look like the place I was brought
up," said Eliza.</p>

<p>They had reached the height of the road now,
and her wistful eyes fell on a cove which pierced
the island's side. Its softly rising banks were
studded with evergreen trees, standing black
above the black water. A threatening sky hung
sullenly over all.</p>

<p>"'Tain't the place you was brought up,"
returned Captain James cheerfully. "It's a
darned sight more prosperous place. While the
summer folks are restin' up, we're makin' hay
and cuttin' ice, as ye might say; and come fall
we get shet of 'em and go back to a quiet life.
No one can't say this ain't a quiet life, can they,
Eliza?"</p>

<p>Captain James reined in the horse before
taking the Foster Hill, and compassion showed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
in his kindly eyes as he turned and watched
the grey face of his passenger.</p>

<p>"Eliza Brewster used to be a pretty girl,"
was his pitiful thought.</p>

<p>She kept silence, her pale eyes resting on the
dark waters of the cove, austerely quiet in the
windless twilight.</p>

<p>"Feels like snow," said Captain James.
"S'pose you could snowball now, Eliza? I know
when we were youngsters you could hold yer
own with any boy on the island."</p>

<p>"That's my one talent, James," responded
Eliza drily. "I can hold my own yet."</p>

<p>The captain smiled with relief at this sign
that some of the old spirit lingered behind that
haggard face.</p>

<p>"By cracky," he said, "I'll bring up a bob-sled
after the first snow, and we'll toboggan downhill
again, Eliza. Never say die. Git ap, Tom."</p>

<p>The carriage started up toward a long low
white house on the summit of the ridge. Four
bare Balm of Gilead trees stood sentinel before
it in a waste of withered grass. Beyond rose the
gnarled boughs of a struggling apple orchard,
beside which a tiny house with blank uncurtained
windows stood beneath the forlorn guard
of two more gaunt bare trees standing ready for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
the conflict with winter winds, and bearing the
scars of many a battle past. Back of the little
building was a shallow field inclining downward
to the open ocean which held the island now
in its black, mighty embrace, creeping with a
subdued roar upon the cold rocky sands.</p>

<p>"Say, Eliza," said Captain James, as the
tiny deserted cottage came into view, "was we
afraid o' Granny Foster, was we? Say!"</p>

<p>The speaker turned and interrogated his
passenger with a twinkle.</p>

<p>A wan smile rewarded him.</p>

<p>"Afterward Jenny used it for chickens, Mrs.
Wright says," she returned.</p>

<p>"Yes; but there never was an old hen there
that come up to Granny Foster, you bet."</p>

<p>"How long ago does that seem to you,
James?" asked Eliza, after a pause.</p>

<p>"As if 'twas yesterday," he responded
valiantly.</p>

<p>His memory was picturing the little girl in
plaid gingham and sunbonnet who could outrun
any boy on the island. That sunbonnet was
never in place, but always hung down Eliza's
back, the strings tied at her throat. Captain
James remembered to have thought there was
something very pleasing about that throat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>"It seems a hundred years ago to me," said
Eliza quietly.</p>

<p>"Whew! You must 'a' lived fast in New
York," returned Captain James. "That's an
awful record."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose I'll ever get used to the
stillness again, James? I believe if a pin was to
drop in this grass you could hear it."</p>

<p>"Guess Nature'll make rumpus enough for
ye before long," returned the captain. "You've
never tried it up on this hill, Eliza. I guess
when the pebbles and rocks begin draggin'
around below there at high tide, you won't miss
the elevated trains none."</p>

<p>The horse was climbing slowly and patiently
as they talked, and a woman within the old
farmhouse was watching the ascent from a
window. Now the watcher disappeared, and
presently the house door opened and a figure
came out on the stone step.</p>

<p>"There's Mrs. Wright now. Git ap, Tom."</p>

<p>A gleam came into Eliza's pale eyes. It was
an attractive figure that stood there in dark
blue gown and white apron. The silver aureole
of hair framed a smiling face. Eliza grasped the
handles of Pluto's basket.</p>

<p>"To think that after all the years I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
have a homecoming on this island!" was her
grateful thought.</p>

<p>"Here we are," called Captain James cheerfully
as they approached; "little box, big box,
bandbox, and bundle, and the cat."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wright approached as the carry-all
stopped.</p>

<p>"Did you really bring a cat, Eliza?" she
asked, laughing.</p>

<p>"Why,&mdash;why," stammered Eliza, "it never
once came to me till this minute that perhaps
you don't like cats!"</p>

<p>"I like everything alive," was the response;
and the speaker looked it, as she received the
cat-basket, and Eliza stepped out on the grass.</p>

<p>"But does Mr. Wright?" inquired Eliza in
perturbation. Was it Pluto's destiny to become
a wild-cat after travelling by land and sea!</p>

<p>That gentleman now appeared, stout and
with tousled hair, which suggested that he had
just risen from slumber.</p>

<p>"This is Eliza Brewster, Morris, and she has
brought us a pet," said Mrs. Wright pleasantly.</p>

<p>The host shook hands with the newcomer
with sufficient grace and eyed the basket curiously.
Captain James looked benignly on the
group.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>"Eliza and me have been lookin' backward as
we came along," he said. "We used to race and
tear around this hill&mdash;she says 'twas a hundred
years ago, but don't you believe it. I'm
goin' to bring a bob-sled, first snow, and sail her
down the hill and make her think 'twa'n't
more'n yesterday that we did it last."</p>

<p>The smile on Eliza's haggard face but made
her fatigue more evident.</p>

<p>"Where's the trunk, Cap'n James?" asked
Mrs. Wright.</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to fetch it right up. Git ap, Tom."</p>

<p>"Hurry in, Mrs. Wright," said Eliza, her
care-taking instinct asserting itself. "You'll
take cold."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," was the reply as the hostess
led the way in; "I never take anything that
doesn't belong to me."</p>

<p>There was a cheerful fire blazing in the living-room
and Eliza was at once seated before it and
made to feel for a second time like an honored
guest.</p>

<p>"I'll let Pluto out, first thing, if you don't
mind," she said, and unfastened the basket.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright, his eyes indolently curious under
the rumpled grey hair, watched the proceeding.</p>

<p>"A Manx cat," he remarked as the prisoner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
leaped out. Pluto's green eyes blazed in the
moment that he stood and looked about him.</p>

<p>"Here, poor thing," said Eliza, "your troubles
are over. There's a fire such as you've
never seen in all your days."</p>

<p>But the outraged cat scorned the fire, scorned
even Eliza's caressing hand. Leaping from her
touch he descried the lounge; and thanking the
gods of his Egyptian ancestors that at last he
had reached a place where furniture accorded
hiding-places, he dashed into the darkest corner
its valance concealed.</p>

<p>"He's kind o' put out by all he's been
through," said Eliza apologetically.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright went to the couch and stooping
lifted the valance.</p>

<p>"Shall I get him for you?" he asked.</p>

<p>Two green eyes blazed at him from the darkness
and a vigorous spitting warned him away.</p>

<p>"Please just let him sulk a little while," said
Eliza hastily. Supposing Pluto should inaugurate
their visit by scratching the host! Awful
thought! "He's a real good cat in his way,"
she added.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm certainly not invited under the
lounge," said Mr. Wright, straightening up.</p>

<p>"I didn't know anybody to give him to,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
went on Eliza, still apologetic. "Mr. Sidney
said he would have taken him if he'd known."</p>

<p>"Mr. Sidney. That's Mrs. Ballard's young
artist, isn't it?" asked Mrs. Wright, who was
boiling a kettle over an alcohol lamp at a tea-table
in the corner of the room.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;we spent our last day with him in
his stable."</p>

<p>"His what, Eliza?"</p>

<p>"His stable. He's found one for a studio in
a real stylish place up in Gramercy Park where
the folks have gone to Europe. He's as tickled
as if he owned the whole big house."</p>

<p>"I'm glad he's found a place to suit him.
You like him very much, don't you, Eliza?"</p>

<p>"He couldn't be any better," said Eliza simply.
"We'd 'a' had a real nice visit only the
Fabian children came in, Edgar and Kathleen."</p>

<p>"Oh, how are they?" asked Mrs. Wright with
interest.</p>

<p>"They seemed to be all right. I hadn't seen
'em for years."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wright remembered Eliza's criticism of
Mrs. Fabian on the occasion of the call she
made upon her in New York.</p>

<p>"Just turn your head," she said, "and you
can see right from where you are sitting the fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
cottage Mr. Fabian built here five years ago in
place of the old one his wife owned."</p>

<p>Eliza turned and looked out the window. Far
across the field and an intervening wall she
could see a house built of boulders, low and
broad, and obtained glimpses of its wide verandas.</p>

<p>"It's a charming place," went on Mrs.
Wright, "and they have a delightful small
yacht. We became acquainted with them during
the last fortnight of Violet's stay in the
summer and she had a few fine sails with them."</p>

<p>Here the hostess rose and brought Eliza a cup
of fragrant tea.</p>

<p>The guest started. "The idea of your waitin'
on me, Mrs. Wright," she said humbly.</p>

<p>"Oh, making tea is fun, Eliza; and I want
you to drink that before I take you to your
room. This isn't any steam-heated apartment,
as you remember."</p>

<p>As she spoke, Mrs. Wright took a cup of tea
to her husband, who was sitting on the couch,
occasionally lifting the valance and peering
beneath, apparently vastly entertained by the
feline explosions with which Pluto, his sharp
teeth bared, spat at the intrusion.</p>

<p>"You won't put your hand under, will you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Mr. Wright?" asked Eliza anxiously. "Pluto's
so quick you'd think 'twas lightnin' struck you.
I'm ashamed of him with this good fire; but he
had an awful time with boys once and that's
where his tail went, and I don't feel to blame
him so much as if he hadn't ever suffered any.
He's scarcely seen any men except Mr. Sidney.
He was clever to him always, but I don't know
as Pluto'll forgive him now for shuttin' him up
in the basket. Oh!" Eliza heaved a sigh of relief,
"I'm so glad we've got here."</p>

<p>"I've put an oil-stove in your room, Eliza,"
said Mrs. Wright, as all three sat sipping their
tea.</p>

<p>"That's real nice," returned Eliza. "Mr.
Sidney's got an oil-stove. I do hope he won't
smoke up everything. I tried to scare him,&mdash;told
him he'd ruin his pictures."</p>

<p>"We shall watch to see him make the success
Mrs. Ballard expected," said Mrs. Wright
kindly, seeing that Eliza's heart was much with
her dear one's heir.</p>

<p>"He couldn't make anything but a success,"
responded Eliza.</p>

<p>Presently her trunk arrived and was carried
into the bedroom which Mrs. Wright had arranged
for her. It was on the ground floor. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
the second story of the house was to be left
unused in the cold weather.</p>

<p>In the evening Captain James came back a
third time to play checkers with Mr. Wright.
It seemed to be a daily custom; but soon after
the supper dishes were washed, Mrs. Wright
insisted on her tired guest getting into bed for a
long night's rest.</p>

<p>Pluto had leaped to the shed and thence
out into the black darkness of the cloud-laden
night.</p>

<p>Eliza went to the door to call him, but her
most ingratiating invitations were ignored.</p>

<p>"Oh, go to bed, Eliza," said Captain James,
who had just opened the checker-board.
"What ye 'fraid of? 'Fraid he'll jump off the
bank? He ain't fond enough o' the water, I'll
bet. Go to bed and don't worry. Haven't ye
ever heard the song, 'The cat came back, he
couldn't stay away'?"</p>

<p>"You know, James," said Eliza, ashamed of
her anxiety, but nevertheless too much affected
by it to seek her pillow while her pet was homeless,
"you know it's places, not people, with a
cat, selfish critters."</p>

<p>"Well," responded the captain, "he can't get
back to New York 'cause the walkin' 's so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
poor." As he spoke, a dark shadow passed into
the light that streamed from the window.</p>

<p>With the quickest movement of her life, Eliza
jumped off the doorstep and pounced upon it.
It was Pluto, and she held him under her arm
with a vice-like grip as she rentered the house.</p>

<p>"Good-night, all," she said, rather shamefaced.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Eliza," said Mrs. Wright, who
had taken up a book. "Your lamp is lighted."</p>

<p>When Eliza had reached her room, she closed
the door and dropped the cat, who leaped
toward it, and finding exit hopeless, looked up
at her, night-fires gleaming in his eyes.</p>

<p>"See here, Pluto," said Eliza severely, "will
you stop actin' so crazy? I tell you we're home;
<em>home</em>. If ever two folks ought to be filled to the
brim with gratitude it's you and me. I'll give
you a chance to look around here in daylight
and get your bearin's, and then, if you don't
behave as if you had some sense, I'll put you in
the chicken-house and you shall live there. Do
you hear that?"</p>

<p>She stooped to smooth the jetty fur to offset
in a measure her severity; but Pluto glided
from beneath her hand and took refuge beneath
the bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, of all the fools!" she soliloquized.
Nevertheless she knew what the temperature of
the room would be by the small hours, and,
taking an old knitted grey shawl from her
trunk, she threw it under the bed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">MRS. FABIAN'S GIFTS</p>


<p>Mrs. Fabian had taken her daughter to the
train before she appeared to Pat's amazed eyes
at the stable door. Her chagrin at discovering
the removal of the barrel did not prevent her
recognition of the discomforts of Phil's north-lighted
chamber. Her nostrils dilated as she
looked about her at the rumpled pile of blankets
where the artist had evidently slept; the unlighted
stove, and the open windows through
which came an eager and a nipping air.</p>

<p>"Poor boy! Poor boy!" she said to herself
repeatedly.</p>

<p>She had had an unpleasant fifteen minutes
with Kathleen in the motor, for the girl had
asked her directly if she intended to kidnap the
missent barrel, and she had replied in an emphatic
affirmative.</p>

<p>"Would you rather have those old dishes
than Mr. Sidney's respect?" Kathleen asked
her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian looked her surprise. "It sounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
very absurd to hear you call Phil 'Mr. Sidney,'"
she said, fencing. "Don't you remember your
Aunt Mary Sidney?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I do."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian's mind was of the sort which
associates social status indissolubly with
money. She had always felt that in winning a
millionaire for a husband, she had married
above her; and, shaking off her own humble
family connection wherever possible, had tried
to be as nearly all Fabian as circumstances permitted.
Her step-children had therefore never
been expected or requested to adopt her relatives
as their own. She now referred to the one
memorable visit of Phil's beautiful mother to
their island home, for Kathleen's persistent
formality in referring to the artist brought a
flush to her cheeks.</p>

<p>If Kathleen, the proud, the reserved, the self-contained,
were to pronounce upon the young
man unfavorably, she should have nothing to
say to the contrary, though she would continue
to be kind to Mary's child in private.</p>

<p>"I was only thinking," she continued, "that
if you still remember his mother in your
thoughts as your Aunt Mary, it seems rather
formal to tack a Mr. upon Philip. You know,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Kathleen," Mrs. Fabian's flush deepened, "I
did not ask you to go to see him. I wanted
Edgar to go, for the looks of the thing, since
Phil is an entire stranger, and when I found he
never would go by himself, I was thankful that
you took him. You have been so&mdash;so grouchy
ever since, that I'm sorry you went; but I don't
see why you should blame me for it. It was
your own proposition."</p>

<p>"I know, mother," returned the girl; "and
if you will promise not to go over there and take
the tea-set I'll not be grouchy." The dark eyes
lifted wistfully to Mrs. Fabian's astonished
countenance.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by my forfeiting Phil's
respect?" she asked. "Do you mean that he
wants them so much? Why, they'll be smashed
or stolen in that rough place. They'll be nothing
but a nuisance to him."</p>

<p>"They belong to Eliza," pleaded Kathleen.</p>

<p>"They belong to me!" retorted Mrs. Fabian
explosively. "Philip will see that at once."</p>

<p>Kathleen's lips closed. They had arrived at
the station, and she said no more; but she
departed with one consoling thought. Mrs.
Fabian had misdirected herself and Edgar the
day before. Perhaps she could not find the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
place to-day; but that lady, as soon as the car
door was closed on her child, spoke through the
tube to the chauffeur.</p>

<p>"Drive," she said, "to the same place in
Gramercy Park where you took Miss Kathleen
yesterday."</p>

<p>Soon she was face to face with Pat, and
presently standing in Phil's forlorn apartment.
The pieces of Mrs. Ballard's bedstead were still
leaning against the wall.</p>

<p>She pictured Kathleen the fastidious, the
dainty, perching on that pile of blankets; but if
the girl had despised the poverty-stricken art-student,
why was she so strenuous and persistent
as to retaining his respect? Why had she
left for the studio in the best of spirits, and
returned distrait, behaving in an absent-minded
manner ever since.</p>

<p>"Kathleen is a great deal more tenderhearted
than she appears. I believe she pitied
Phil so much it made her blue, and she couldn't
bear to have me take away the only pretty
things he had. Well, it seems I'm not going
to!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian even opened the closet door. A
few suits of clothes hung within, but the rest
was chaos; and in that chaos no welcome curves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
of a barrel were to be found. Her alert eyes
made a hasty but comprehensive search of the
room.</p>

<p>"The boy drank his coffee out of that mug!"
she decided. "He is not in a mountain camp
and he shall not live as if he were. He shall see
that he is not dependent on Eliza Brewster for
the decencies of life!"</p>

<p>Then followed her descent upon Pat, her
catechism, and her magnificent departure.</p>

<p>Scarcely had Phil received the Irishman's
account of the visit and gone up to his room
that afternoon, when he heard a knocking on
the stable door; and when Pat had opened it, a
violent expletive from somebody.</p>

<p>Phil stood still to listen. Surely he could not
be connected with the present invasion, whatever
it might be. His circle of acquaintance in
Gotham had come, done its best and its worst,
and departed for all time.</p>

<p>"Misther Sidney, sor," yelled Pat from the
foot of the stairs. "'T is the barr'l come back.
Sure, and is it worth while totin' it up, whin
it can't be at rest!"</p>

<p>"It isn't for me," called Phil, coming out in
his little hallway. "I refuse to live in such a
whirl of excitement."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is fer you, else all the money spint on
me eddication is gone fer nothin'&mdash;and faith
there's more to follow," added Pat, in a tone
of such sudden surprise that Phil ran downstairs
faster than he had gone up. A couch was
approaching the stable door. This was followed
by several large packages, upon one of which
was tied a letter, and at last a Morris chair
entered upon the scene.</p>

<p>"Ye're the very soul of extravagance," said
Pat severely, when the delivery man had departed.
"If ye're a poor art-shtudent, say so;
but if ye're a prince in disguise, out with it!"</p>

<p>"This is a surprise party if I ever had one,"
declared Phil slowly, staring around at the
objects.</p>

<p>"Poor art-shtudents don't buy iligant couches
with box springs long enough fer the lord
mayor!" said Pat, unconvinced. "What brings
ye to a stable whin ye've the Queen o' Sheby
fer an aunt?"</p>

<p>At the word a light illumined the situation.</p>

<p>"For a fact, Pat! You did tell me my aunt
was here!" And in a flash Phil's mind reverted
to Kathleen with a sensation of gratitude. In
some way she had prevented the disagreeable
details of yesterday from angering her mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>"Give me a hand up, Pat," he said. "I'll
guarantee this barrel will stay where it's put."</p>

<p>When they had all the articles upstairs, Phil
found himself possessed of a springy bed with
ample clothing for the night, and ample couch
cushions for day; well-selected dishes, alcohol
lamp and copper kettle, and a table on which to
stand them, a reading-lamp, and the easy-chair.</p>

<p>"What do you think of it?" he said, looking
about half-dazed.</p>

<p>"I think ye're in the wrong box, bein' in a
stable," answered Pat, scratching his head in
perplexity.</p>

<p>"No, no," Phil laughed; "a box stall for me.
Wait till you see me scattering paint around
here."</p>

<p>"Faith, I have me doubts o' you," said Pat.</p>

<p>His Irish dislike of voicing the unpleasant
withheld him from expressing his thought; but
as he regarded Phil now, standing coatless, and
with tossed hair, looking about his transformed
apartment, he decided that he was viewing the
black sheep of a wealthy family, the masculine
members of which had left him to his own poverty-stricken
devices, while his softer-hearted
female relatives were surreptitiously ameliorating
his hard lot. It was difficult to see Phil in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
the rle of black sheep, but Pat was sophisticated
and knew that appearances were deceitful.</p>

<p>"Pat," said the perplexing tenant suddenly,
"I begin to believe I was born with a silver
spoon in my mouth. I'm the happiest fellow
in the world."</p>

<p>"Sure a man doesn't say that till his wedding-day,"
objected Pat.</p>

<p>Phil smiled confidently. "I told you I had
the girl; and she's the faithfullest of the faithful."</p>

<p>"You bet she is," returned the Irishman devoutly.
"Whativer you've done, the gurr'l gets
her hands on you once'll niver let go."</p>

<p>"Whatever I've done? What do you think
I've done?" laughed Phil. "Here's my mother.
Want to see her?" And he sorted several leaves
from the pile of sketches and laid them out on
the new table.</p>

<p>"It's swate she is!" said the Irishman, gazing
with interest; and, perceiving the expression in
the artist's eyes as he looked upon the pictures,
he spoke suspiciously: "She ain't the gurr'l
ye're talkin' of?"</p>

<p>"No, no," returned Phil, "but she entirely
approves of the match."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>"That helps, ye know," said Pat benevolently.
"'Tis well to get airly settled in life,
thin if"&mdash;he made a lenient gesture&mdash;"if
ye've played too many cards or made any
other mistakes, ye soon lave thim behind ye and
there's little time wasted."</p>

<p>That evening Phil called up the Fabian house,
and, finding that Mrs. Fabian was to be at
home, soon presented himself in that lady's
boudoir.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian, in a becoming nglige, sat
before an open fire; a soft lamp at her elbow,
and a French novel in her hand.</p>

<p>"You know the naughty things in a French
story are so stimulating, Phil," she explained,
when he commented on her book. "You
wouldn't think of reading the same things in
English; but you get so curious to know what
it's all about, that you work, and study, and I
find it very helpful. Excuse my not rising to
greet you. I've had an exhausting day; so as
Edgar wasn't coming home, and Mr. Fabian
had to attend a banquet, I had my dinner
brought to me here."</p>

<p>"I'm sure it is I who have exhausted you,"
said Phil, drawing his chair close to the luxurious
downy nest which was embracing her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
plump person. "I don't know what to say to
you, Aunt Isabel," he added gratefully, regarding
her as she half-reclined, a living example of
what can be accomplished by beauty-doctor
and accomplished maid.</p>

<p>She placed her white hand, with its perfect
rosy tips, for an instant on his, then she patted
the folds of her violet gown.</p>

<p>"Now, don't say a word, my dear," she returned,
complacency lighting her countenance.
Her husband had little time for compliments,
Edgar was uniformly ungrateful, and Phil was
very handsome. She remembered how charming
had seemed to her the relation between him
and his mother; and she felt a longing to evoke
something like that affection for herself.</p>

<p>"But, indeed, I shall say a great deal," he
declared. "You've turned my camp over there
into the lap of luxury. I go on accepting things,
everybody seems in a conspiracy to prevent my
having any hardships, so I suspect I'm going to
catch them at the school."</p>

<p>"Aren't the teachers agreeable?"</p>

<p>"Well, I've been there only a few days, but I
see already that doctors disagree there as they
do elsewhere. One comes and tells you you're
all right, and the next declares you're all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
wrong; but I'm after the fundamental training
I've never had, and I'm going to get it if I
make their lives a burden to them."</p>

<p>"I don't pretend to know anything about
art, Phil," said the hostess complacently, "and
I'm not going to add that I know what I like,
either, so you needn't smile at the fire; but
from those sketches of yours that I saw out at
the mine I could see that you were bound to
accomplish something if you had free rein.
Kathleen was delighted with them."</p>

<p>"I was much pleased to meet Miss Fabian,"
said Phil.</p>

<p>"Dear me, why should you children be so
formal!" exclaimed his hostess. "'Miss Fabian'!
'Mr. Sidney'! It's ridiculous when you
consider your mother and me&mdash;more like
sisters than cousins as we are."</p>

<p>Philip bit his lip. The description struck him
as diverting, considering the lapse of years
during which his mother had heard nothing
from this cousin.</p>

<p>"I shall be very glad if Miss Fabian will let
me know her better," he said.</p>

<p>"It's a very, very strange thing, Phil," went
on Mrs. Fabian, shaking her waved head and
gazing at the fire, "to be a step-mother. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
should have always said that environment was
more powerful than heredity; but I've had
those children almost from babyhood,"&mdash;the
speaker challenged Phil with impressive eyes,&mdash;"and
yet I look at them, yes, I assure you, I
look at them as a hen might look at the ducks
she had hatched."</p>

<p>Phil saw that he was intended to respond, so
he changed his position and made a soft, inarticulate
exclamation.</p>

<p>"Those children," declared Mrs. Fabian,
"would probably both claim that they understood
me from <em>a</em> to <em>z</em>; but I am frank enough to
state that I understand neither of them. Now,
I'm going to tell you, Phil, that I am hanging
great hopes upon your influence over Edgar."</p>

<p>"My dear Aunt Isabel!" ejaculated the visitor.
Phil's gratitude to this relative did not
blind him to her characteristics, or as to how
her idle and fashionable life had reflected in the
bringing-up or coming-up of her son.</p>

<p>"Now, don't say no, Phil," she went on. "I
don't expect that you found any kindred spirit
in Edgar, but I'm going to be frank, his father
is so out of patience with him that he is severe,
and I am hoping that the sight of your economy
will show Edgar that something beside extrava<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>gance
can bring happiness; and the sight of
your industry will rebuke his idle tastes."</p>

<p>"I can't conceive of myself as an example to
the young," laughed Phil uncomfortably. "I
half suspected yesterday that you had been
holding me up before Edgar. There aren't any
comparisons to be made between a gilded youth
and a painter, and I assure you it is no lofty
principle that makes me care little where I live
and eat. It is only a desire to do a certain thing,
so intense that it dwarfs every other need."</p>

<p>"He has overpowering desires, too," said
Mrs. Fabian bitterly; "but it is to go yachting
and play polo and drink champagne." She
sighed. "I suppose I haven't known how to be
a good mother," she added with dejection, "but
there,"&mdash;her voice grew suddenly argumentative,&mdash;"look
at Kathleen! I've brought them
up alike, but she is the other extreme. She has
no taste for pleasure. She's a natural student
and bookworm; and what I am to do with her
when she graduates, Heaven only knows. I
shall insist upon her coming out," added Mrs.
Fabian virtuously. "She must go through the
same form as the other girls in her set, and it
may be that a reaction will set in and she will
find a normal satisfaction in it. It will break my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
heart if she drops out and becomes one of these
poky oddities. Well,"&mdash;another sigh,&mdash;"I
mustn't borrow trouble. Were you surprised
at my early morning call at your room, Phil? I
hoped I should be early enough to catch you."</p>

<p>"I was surprised; but it was a lucky visit for
me, even though I was not there."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you're pleased with those little
comforts; but I shall be frank,&mdash;it was to try
to get my grandmother's silver that I went. If
you had known you were working against me,
Phil, you wouldn't have helped that crazy
Eliza to carry the things away."</p>

<p>"They belong to her, she tells me," said Phil
simply. "Aunt Mary seemed to think you were
living in an embarrassment of riches anyway."</p>

<p>"Then you should have shipped them to your
mother. It's quite indecent that a servant
should have them. It reflects upon your mother
and me. Can't you see that, Phil?"</p>

<p>He stirred his broad shoulders uncomfortably.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you aren't going to blame me for
it anyway," he returned, looking at his hostess
with a frank smile. "After all they're only
<em>things</em>, you know. The important part is how
Aunt Mary felt about them, isn't it? You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
know probably what sort of thoughts she had
about you in her last days."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian looked at him with quick
suspicion as he rose to go. Was he rebuking
her in spite of his smile?</p>

<p>"Some people marry into a family," she
said after the pause. "Some marry out of one.
I did both. I married a man with children, and
a big establishment. I simply married out of
my family. I didn't have time to attend to
both, and any right-minded person can see
where my duty lay!"</p>

<p>The virtuousness in the speaker's face and
voice were so enveloping that they created an
atmosphere in which Phil was able to make his
adieux without further embarrassment.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">MRS. FABIAN'S DINNER LIST</p>


<p>For the next two months, Phil, to his entire
satisfaction, had practically no social life. One
or two of his fellow students found their way to
the stable studio, envying him loudly when
they viewed it, but for the most part he succeeded
in keeping his castle to himself. Aunt
Mary's easel found a good situation beneath the
north light, and the evenings were spent in reading
works calculated to help him on his way.</p>

<p>Occasionally the satisfactoriness of his lamp or
his easy-chair would cause him to start in a panic
and begin to figure how long a time had elapsed
since he had called on his benefactress; usually
discovering that it was high time to go again.</p>

<p>Frequently he declined invitations from Mrs.
Fabian to dine, giving the excuse of incessant
occupation. Once in a while, on the occasion of
these duty calls, he saw Edgar, and the latter
prided himself on the subtle implication of
injury which he infused into the perfunctory
courtesy of a host.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Phil saw it, and, while he was amused, he
gave Edgar some credit for not having carried
out the threat to tell his mother how Phil had
guarded her dignity with Eliza.</p>

<p>"So there are some things too petty for him,
after all," thought Phil carelessly; but he suspected
and was grateful for Kathleen's intervention.</p>

<p>When Edgar was not in evidence, Phil rather
enjoyed an evening with his aunt. It gave him
an opportunity to talk about his mother, and
Mrs. Fabian could tell him events of their girlhood.
She soon found that no occurrence in
which Mary Sidney had figured was too trifling
to bring the light of close attention into the
young fellow's eyes.</p>

<p>"Dear me," she said one night when they
were alone together, and she had been entertaining
him with reminiscence, "I wonder
how your mother made you love her
so."</p>

<p>There was a sincere wistfulness in her tone
that touched Phil. He laughed with some embarrassment,
throwing a glance around the too-gorgeous
room.</p>

<p>"I don't believe she went for to do it," he
said. "I contracted the habit early."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>"But Edgar was only five years old when I
married his father," said Mrs. Fabian plaintively.</p>

<p>"We didn't have any money," said Phil.
"Perhaps that helped. Mother and I were pals,
you see; had to be. She could afford only one
maid."</p>

<p>"It's true I was very, very busy," admitted
Mrs. Fabian thoughtfully, with the return of
her ever-ready tone of virtue. "I had the best
nurses and governesses. They couldn't speak a
word of English,&mdash;and I didn't neglect the
children. I made it a point to hear them say
their prayers every night that I wasn't going
out."</p>

<p>Phil's clasped finger tips were pressed to his
lips and he did not reply to this. He admired
Mrs. Fabian's exquisite costumes, and now he
dropped his twinkling eyes to the hem of her
gossamer gown.</p>

<p>"How often do you write to your mother?"
pursued Mrs. Fabian.</p>

<p>"I'd be ashamed to tell you," he answered.</p>

<p>She sighed. "It's beautiful," she declared;
again wistful. "I suppose she has told you
about our dear old dull island."</p>

<p>"Brewster's Island? I don't remember her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
talking of it; but Eliza has spoken of my mother
having been there."</p>

<p>At the mention of her humble enemy Mrs.
Fabian's nostrils dilated. "Eliza!" she repeated
indignantly. "Every time I think of the
impudence of that woman&mdash;" she paused, at a
loss for words.</p>

<p>"I suppose the island was named for Eliza's
family," hazarded Phil.</p>

<p>"I suppose so. You may call nearly every
islander 'Brewster,' and seldom go wrong." Mrs.
Fabian continued: "Edgar made a joke of the
barrel affair, but Kathleen put on tragedy airs
at the idea of my trying to get my own. Kathleen
knows so much more than her mother, you
understand. She knows so much more about
everything than she will ten years from now.
It's rather painful. Well, of course you didn't
realize what you were doing in helping Eliza
spirit the things away. I'm glad the creature
has gone, for your sake. She would have been a
dreadful bore to you as a part of Aunt Mary's
legacy."</p>

<p>"I feel very kindly toward Eliza," said Phil.
Aunt Mary's letter was against his heart where
it always lay. "She did too much for Aunt
Mary for me ever to forget it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>"But you didn't know Aunt Mary."</p>

<p>"Not until she had gone. Then she revealed
herself to me in a letter. I seem to have seen
her at her patient work."</p>

<p>"Yes, and Eliza has probably told you that
I neglected her." Mrs. Fabian colored and
looked at Phil defensively.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered simply.</p>

<p>"It's a wonder she didn't make you hate
me. I know what a virago the creature can
be."</p>

<p>"I like," said Phil,&mdash;"I like that saying,
'Yesterday is as dead as Egypt.' I like to feel
that the only enemy a man can have is himself."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you don't hate me, Phil," returned
Mrs. Fabian, again plaintive. "I have enough
troubles. 'Qui s'excuse, s'accuse,' and I shall
not try to explain to you why I saw so little of
Aunt Mary; but it is beyond belief that a common
creature like Eliza should dare to sit in
judgment on a person in my position."</p>

<p>"Eliza is not a common creature," said Phil
quietly.</p>

<p>"I see. Her devotion is all you think of. We
won't talk of her, then.&mdash;What are you going
to do in the summer, Phil?"</p>

<p>"Work!" he answered, smiling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not under that stable roof. I won't permit
it."</p>

<p>"Then I'll take the road. There's nothing I
know better than how to be a tramp."</p>

<p>At this juncture Mr. Fabian came in from his
library. He was a smooth-shaven man, comfortably
stout; and the stern lines on his forehead
and about his mouth softened at sight of
Phil, who rose to greet him.</p>

<p>"What of the mine?" asked the newcomer,
seating himself.</p>

<p>"Oh, father's digging away," returned Phil.
"He probably tells you more than he does me."</p>

<p>Mr. Fabian drew his brows together.</p>

<p>"Not sick of the picture business yet?" he
asked, regarding the young man curiously.</p>

<p>Phil shook his head and laughed. He knew Mr.
Fabian's disapproval of his chosen profession.</p>

<p>"I was just about telling Phil," said Mrs.
Fabian, "that he must visit us at the island
next summer."</p>

<p>Mr. Fabian nodded cordially. "Care for
sailing?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I never had a chance to know. Horses and
tramping and camping have given me all my
outings so far."</p>

<p>"Then you must come. We'll have a cruise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
I've only a small yacht, for I prefer to run it
myself with a few friends."</p>

<p>"That sounds attractive, but I shan't
indulge, I think."</p>

<p>"Why, what sort of a painter is it who
doesn't do marines?" asked Mrs. Fabian.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," returned Phil, smiling. "I'll
do them at Coney Island."</p>

<p>When he had taken his departure Mrs.
Fabian turned to her husband.</p>

<p>"Isn't it a shame," she said, "for a boy like
that not to have any money?"</p>

<p>"No," responded her husband. "It's in his
favor. The shame is that a fine husky chap like
that should give himself over to paint-pots. I'd
make a position for him in the office if he'd
come. I wish I had a son like that."</p>

<p>When her husband made this sort of reference,
Mrs. Fabian was glad that she was not
Edgar's own mother; yet since she had known
Phil she had never entirely escaped a consciousness
that Mary Sidney would have bent the
twig in Edgar's childhood in a manner to have
produced a different inclination in the tree.</p>

<p>As Christmas approached, Mrs. Fabian detained
her son one evening as he was about to
leave the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>"Edgar, you are always in such a hurry," she
complained. "I never can catch you for a word
except at table when the servants are about.
Sit down for five minutes."</p>

<p>The youth paused reluctantly. "I must keep
my engagements," he said, shrugging his
shoulders, "and since the Administration has
shut down on my using the car at night, I have
to live by my wits; in other words, sponge on
other people's motors as much as possible."</p>

<p>"You know, dear," said Mrs. Fabian, "your
father didn't do that until we found, evening
after evening, that we could never have the
car ourselves. Somehow or other, Edgar, you
manage very badly. You always rub your father
the wrong way."</p>

<p>Edgar's chest in his dress shirt rose very
high. "I'm not the cringing, begging sort," he
returned. "Unless a thing is offered me freely
I don't care for it."</p>

<p>In the last month he had affected a short,
pointed mustache, and this he now twisted with
a haughty air.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian's sense of humor was latent, but
she smiled now. "Sit down a minute, dear,"
she said. "It won't detain you, for you may
use the car to-night. Your father has just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
'phoned that he is obliged to attend a sudden
meeting of directors, so I have to give up the
opera&mdash;unless you will go with me?"</p>

<p>Edgar regarded his mother's charming toilet
appraisingly. "I don't mind," he said graciously,
"if you will ask Mrs. Larrabee. I was
going there to call to-night."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian's brow clouded. "She is so conspicuous,"
she said persuasively; "I wish you
didn't go there, Edgar. Why are all the men
daft about her when there are so many sweet
young girls so much better worth their attention?"</p>

<p>"Shall I see if she is disengaged?" asked
Edgar alertly. "If she cares to go I can come
back and talk with you."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," Mrs. Fabian sighed resignedly;
and Edgar disappeared, presently returning,
a self-satisfied smile curving the little mustache.</p>

<p>"She was gracious, evidently," remarked
Mrs. Fabian.</p>

<p>"Says she was saving this evening for me
anyway, and will be delighted," said Edgar,
seating himself. "She says she is glad it is a
Caruso night, for she can prove to me that I
ought to be on his side of the footlights."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's the way she does it, is it?" returned
Mrs. Fabian.</p>

<p>"Oh, she means it," declared Edgar quickly.
"She's the most sincere creature alive. Everybody
knows that."</p>

<p>"Where is Mr. Larrabee? I've never seen
him yet. Does anybody see him?"</p>

<p>"His clerks, I fancy," returned Edgar, with
his careless, gleeful smile.</p>

<p>"It's really a pity the woman's so well connected,"
said Mrs. Fabian. "She is insolently
daring. Did you tell her you were taking me?"</p>

<p>"I told her you were asking her to be so good
as to accept an impromptu invitation; that you
had but just found that you could go, yourself."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian sighed again. "Well, Edgar,
then I have earned a few minutes of your time.
I'm going to give a dinner for you and Kathleen
while she is at home for the holidays. I thought
of Christmas night, with a little informal dance
afterward; and I want you to help me decide on
the list."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Larrabee?" suggested Edgar, twisting
his mustache complacently.</p>

<p>"Certainly not," returned his mother, with
energy. "This is to be just for your and Kath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>leen's
young friends&mdash;a simple Christmas
merry-making."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you let me off?" asked Edgar,
with his most blas, man-of-the-world air.</p>

<p>"Don't be absurd, Edgar Fabian. Have you
no interest in helping to make your sister's
holidays pleasant?"</p>

<p>"My dear mother," protested the young
man, "in order to make Kath's holidays
pleasant, all you need to do is to give her a pair
of blue spectacles for a Christmas gift, and invite
a few Columbia professors to engage her in
light conversation. If I should send her roses,
she would only analyze them and reel off the
learned names of their innards."</p>

<p>"Very well; I am giving you an opportunity
to suggest some names if you care to. Of course
I shall ask Philip Sidney."</p>

<p>Edgar shrugged again. "Do you suppose he
has any evening clothes?"</p>

<p>"And Kathleen suggested Violet Manning,"
went on Mrs. Fabian. "Do you remember
Mrs. Wright's niece? Her life must be a dull
one.</p>

<p>"So it is to be a dinner party of derelicts,"
said Edgar; "a charity affair."</p>

<p>"Kathleen is always thoughtful," said Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Fabian reproachfully. "As it is to be on
Christmas Day I don't know that trying to
give pleasure to some people who don't have
much usually would be so far out of the way.
I'm not sure about Miss Manning myself.
Kathleen has suggested once or twice that, as
we saw quite a little of her at the island, it
might be well to show her some courtesy here;
but, as I say, I'm not quite sure. What I am
sure of is that I will not allow you to speak of
Philip Sidney slightingly in my presence."</p>

<p>Edgar looked up in some surprise.</p>

<p>"A derelict, indeed," she went on. "I wish I
might ever hope to see you bring the look into
your father's eyes that they hold when he sees
Phil."</p>

<p>"You choose a fine way to make me like
him!" answered the youth; but beneath his
carelessness was a twinge which proved that the
words went home. "I remember Miss Manning
now. She sailed with us a few times."</p>

<p>"Yes, and she lives here with some girl students
in a bachelor-maid way, and teaches&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I remember the whole thing!" interrupted
Edgar. "She dances."</p>

<p>"What! The stage?" asked Mrs. Fabian.</p>

<p>"No; some sort of school business; more on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
the gymnastic order. Of course, I remember
her. She did a jig once on the boat."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't think we'd better ask her,"
exclaimed Mrs. Fabian hastily.</p>

<p>"Yes, put her down," said Edgar. "If we're
going into the charity business, I greatly prefer
worthy girls who can jig; and for the rest, you
and Kath fix it up. Christmas is a sort of a lost
night anyway. I don't mind."</p>

<p>And with this gracious cooperation Mrs.
Fabian was fain to be content. Although she
felt somewhat dubious about sending an invitation
to Violet Manning, she concluded from
the vivacity in Edgar's countenance, as memory
awakened, that the purchase of his interest
was worth the risk.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian did not care for sailing, and she
had but a vague memory of an inoffensive girl
who arrived at the island as Mrs. Wright's
niece. She hoped Miss Manning's propensity
for jigging would not be the cause of any shock
to the carefully nurtured buds who were
Kathleen's friends.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">CHRISTMAS</p>


<p>It was shortly after this that a miniature riot
broke out in the tiny apartment where Violet
Manning and her two friends made a home; and
it was on the subject of Christmas, too.</p>

<p>The year before, Violet had spent the holidays
with Mrs. Wright in Boston; but this year
the loving letter which she now held in her
hand invited her cordially not to come to the
island.</p>

<p>"I want to see my little girl," wrote Mrs.
Wright, "but I would rather risk the sort of
days you will spend among the many pupils
who are sure to ask you than to let you take the
expensive journey to the island, so bleak and
cold as it is, and with nothing to repay you at
this end but a hug from Aunt Amy."</p>

<p>Violet read this aloud, and her two friends
listened attentively.</p>

<p>"I told you," said Roxana, the teacher and
the eldest, "that Mrs. Wright wouldn't let you
come. I shall stay here with you." She spoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
firmly. Her face had the lines of one who always
spoke firmly.</p>

<p>"Then I shall stay, too", said Regina, the
art-student.</p>

<p>"Then you'll make me miserable, girls!"
ejaculated Violet energetically, folding her
letter back in its envelope. She was sitting on
the table, a favorite perch not to be despised in
that box of a room where she often said one
must either be under the table or on it. She
swung both her slippered feet and her blonde
head. "Roxy&mdash;Rex&mdash;" she added beseechingly,
"do you want to ruin my holidays?"</p>

<p>"Rex can go, it's very foolish for her to talk
about staying, when she can go sleighing in the
country and study the shadows on the snow,"
said Roxana.</p>

<p>"What's the use of being a bachelor girl if
you can't have any independence?" inquired
Violet, her blue eyes, and full, pretty lips looking
stormy.</p>

<p>"The baby bachelor can't have everything
she wants," said Roxana. "You're the baby
bachelor. Rex may do approximately as she
pleases, but I am the only one entirely independent.
Rex still waves her hair. I stopped a
year ago; just forgot it. That was the rubicon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Have you heard of the old colored mammy who
deplored the failure of her dear but mature miss
to marry? She said to her consolingly: 'Never
mine, honey, I'se known some old maids who
settled down right happy and contented when
they stopped strugglin'.' I knew when I forgot
to wave my hair that I'd stopped 'strugglin'."
Roxana rocked gently. It was the only safe
way to rock in that apartment. "So when that
time comes, Violet, you will see that you have
earned independence."</p>

<p>"Oh, Rox, don't be so unkind," pleaded
Violet. "I've had ever so many invitations for
Christmas dinner from parents. I knew my
small admirers slapped them into it, so I refused;
but I give you my word that if you will
go ahead with your Christmas plans, I will
write to one of the most ardent, and Cinderella's
coach will be nothing compared to the
limousine that will be sent for me Christmas
morning, and nothing will be lacking but the
prince to make the story complete. If you don't
promise, I'll sulk all the holidays, and I won't
stay with you either. I'll go skating in the park."</p>

<p>Roxana smiled meditatively.</p>

<p>"Prince!" repeated Regina ecstatically.
"That reminds me of mine again."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, help!" exclaimed Violet. "I've reminded
her of Mr. What's-his-name. Rex, if
you'll promise to go ahead with your holiday
doings, I'll let you tell us again how He came
into the class-room first, and how He chose the
best light, and how His sketches were always
stunning, and how hard it was for you not to
sketch Him instead of the model, and I'll let
you show me the head you did of Him on the sly,
and you shall tell us again how you plotted for an
introduction and how you didn't get it, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, hush up," said Regina good-naturedly.
"How about that Mr. Fabian you met at the
island? How about the careless elegance of his
manners? How about that wonderful, heartrending,
angelic voice in which he sang on
moonlight sails?"</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said Violet, swinging her feet
and smiling with mischievous eyes, "what a
wonderful memory you have! I had forgotten
all about him."</p>

<p>"It shows what a superior being he considers
himself that he has allowed you to," retorted
Regina, with curling lip; "after the way he
behaved at the island&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I never said he behaved," interrupted
Violet mildly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, he kept on asking you to go, every
time they sailed, and gave you every reason to
think he was friendly."</p>

<p>"That's summer friendship," returned Violet,
but her cheeks took a deeper rose. The
shoe pinched.</p>

<p>"Well, it's settled," said Roxana. "Rex proceeds
to the farm and studies snow shadows. I
stay here, and sleep as late as I wish in the
morning. Now, be calm, Violet. It isn't as if I
had a home to go to. It wouldn't be all holiday
to visit, and be on my best behavior, and not be
sure which fork to use nor how large tips I
ought to give the servants, nor&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" interrupted Violet. "It will do
you all the good in the world to sit down in the
lap of luxury for a while; to live in large rooms,
and drive in large motors, and eat large dinners,
and lounge on large divans, and sleep in large
beds; and you're going, Rex, you're going."</p>

<p>There was something like tears in the stormy
blue eyes, and Regina heard with relief the
postman's whistle.</p>

<p>"Go down and see if we have anything,
will you, Violet? I'm fixed so comfortably, and
it's nothing to hop off the table."</p>

<p>Violet obeyed, and the other bachelors saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
her press a very small handkerchief to her eyes
as she went.</p>

<p>"You'd better go, Rox," said Regina in a low
tone. "I know just how she feels."</p>

<p>"If it weren't for Christmas day I would;
but I am sure Violet won't accept a pupil's
hospitality for more than an hour, just so she
can tell us she went; and the baby shan't spend
Christmas eve and Christmas night alone.
Even if she won't speak to me, I shall stay. It's
the lesser of two evils. Honestly, I would enjoy
a lazy time at home here with no papers to
correct. The trouble is to get her to believe it."</p>

<p>Here Violet returned; her face and bearing so
laden with dignity that Roxana coughed lest
she laugh. The baby bachelor handed a postcard
to Regina, then took a very straight-backed
chair. To sit on either of her customary
thrones, the table or the floor, would be too
much concession to her mutinous companions.
She opened the letter in her hand, and as she
read, a curious change altered her countenance.
The wintry stiffness of her expression began to
thaw. A springtime warmth appeared in her
eyes, and, spreading to her lips, relaxed their
corners. At last she looked up. The sparkle of
summer seas shone in her glance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>"You can go, girls," she said; "it is all right.
Mrs. Fabian has asked me to dinner on Christmas,
with a dance afterward and to spend the
night. Now, then!" She challenged Roxana
triumphantly.</p>

<p>"How about Christmas eve?" inquired the
latter inflexibly.</p>

<p>"You tiresome old dear, the Settlement has a
tree and I'll attend it, and spend the night with
one of my class who is interested there."</p>

<p>"Then I'll go," agreed Roxana mildly.
"Fled is the rosy dream of sleeping till noon and
watching you skate in the afternoons; and I will
ask Mrs. McCabe across the hall to keep an eye
on you."</p>

<p>The invitation came as a welcome event to
Philip Sidney as well. Aunt Isabel had been
uniformly kind and motherly to him. The
thought of a solitary Christmas, or one spent in
a glittering restaurant, made him wince even
with all the allurements of his easel and his
books; so at last Mrs. Fabian received a grateful
reply to a dinner invitation.</p>

<p>The roses that came with his card on Christmas
morning pleased her also, more than her
extravagant gifts. While Phil was dressing he
thought again of Kathleen. He had never seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
her since the Sunday afternoon visit. He felt
he could put up with Edgar's airs and graces
through a dinner for the sake of seeing Kathleen
again.</p>

<p>"I wonder if she'll smoke a cigarette to-night,"
he thought, while he adjusted the dress
tie he had bought for the occasion: adjusted it
very carefully, for the tie was a unique possession.
If he made a botch of it he could not go
to the dinner. The girl never came to his mind
except when her mother spoke of her; but now
that he was to be her guest he recalled agreeably
how womanly and sweet had been her
manner to Eliza on that autumn day before the
stable had turned into a studio.</p>

<p>It was Kathleen who suggested sending the
car for Violet. It was not the traditional Christmas
of dry sparkling snow under a radiant
moon, but a day of slush and clouds, and Kathleen
was not of those owners of motors who
believe that every one else has one, too. Her
acquaintance with Violet was slight, but she
knew she was a teacher and a very young one.
She fancied that dollars were precious with her
as yet.</p>

<p>So Violet rolled up to the brown-stone house
on Christmas evening in state, arrayed in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
best and full of anticipation. Mrs. Wright's
gift to her had been a small gold pendant holding
a turquoise matrix, and this she wore on a
slender chain around her throat, where it shone
between the deep blue of her eyes and the pale
blue of her gown.</p>

<p>Kathleen's greeting to her had a ring of
friendliness through its gentle formality. Violet's
involuntary thought was that she might
have been less formal, for, although there was
nothing chilling in her manner, it seemed to
suggest the difference between the bachelor
maid doing light housekeeping in a hemmed-in
apartment and the heiress of this stately
mansion.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian was kindly patronizing, and
held Violet at her side that she might meet the
other dinner guests.</p>

<p>Edgar Fabian was one of the last to enter the
drawing-room. Violet noted that he was not
alone, but although his companion dwarfed him
she saw no one but the well-set-up, exquisite
youth with the shining hair who had been the
companion of her moonlight sails. Her heart
quickened and her color deepened.</p>

<p>"I'm behaving exactly like Rex," she
thought impatiently. Really there had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
no reason why Edgar Fabian should take pains
to find her in the city or show her any courtesy,
after the return from the island, but in her heart
of hearts she had expected he would; and it
showed no proper pride in this same heart to
give an undignified bound at the present juncture.
What was the idiotic thing bounding for
anyway?</p>

<p>This query she put to it as Edgar approached
his mother; and now Violet saw that his companion
was a tall man whose evening clothes
could not lessen the breadth of his shoulders,
and whose poetic face was lighted with alert,
observant eyes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian greeted the stranger warmly,
and presented him to Violet as her nephew, Mr.
Sidney; while Edgar's cool eyes swept the girl's
face for a brief moment without recognition.</p>

<p>"You remember Miss Manning, Edgar,"
said his mother; and then the sudden gleeful
smile relieved the youth's face of its superciliousness.</p>

<p>"What a difference feathers make to the bird,
Miss Manning!" he ejaculated. "Upon my
word, I think I must have believed you always
wore a jolly little red sweater and hat.
Weren't those corking sails we had? Awfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
glad to see you again." And he bore Phil off
to meet his friends.</p>

<p>"I think, Miss Manning," said Mrs. Fabian
impressively, "that in meeting my nephew you
have seen a future celebrity. He is wonderfully
talented."</p>

<p>"How pleasant," murmured Violet, the idiot
heart having given one record-breaking bound
and then retired into its usual self-effacement.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is a painter. Only a student as yet,
of course. I think he has the sort of originality
that longs to spread its wings and fly; but he
holds himself down to foundation work in the
most level-headed way."</p>

<p>Violet's eyes followed the easy movements of
the athletic figure.</p>

<p>"Studying art, did you say?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I didn't quite get his name?"</p>

<p>"Sidney. Philip Sidney."</p>

<p>Stars began to twinkle in Violet's eyes at her
sudden enlightenment. What would Rex say?</p>

<p>Kathleen Fabian's observing eyes found time
to follow Phil, too. He wore his dress clothes
more like one accustomed to inhabit palaces
than stables. She saw girlish eyes brighten
as Edgar personally conducted the Westerner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
about the room. When she planned to sit next
him at dinner, it had been with a thought of
protection; as Edgar had been lavish of prophecies
of the probable <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gaucherie</i> of the cowboy.
She also had believed it quite likely that the
mining engineer did not possess a dress suit;
and Edgar had drawn cheerful pictures of the
way his arms and legs would probably protrude
from any which he might rent; but it was quite
evident now that Phil had a good tailor and had
not spent all his evenings in a mountain cabin.</p>

<p>Kathleen had suggested to her brother that
he be seated beside Violet Manning, as there
would be no other man present whom she had
ever seen, but Edgar vetoed that plan.</p>

<p>"Let the two derelicts go in together," he had
said. "I never did see any sense in this business
of social philanthropy. Let the lonely people
take care of each other. They will if you only
have the cleverness to bring them together.
Then you're spared all the boredom yourself,
and kill two birds with one stone."</p>

<p>"My dear," his mother had said, "Miss Manning
is an orphan, alone in the city, and you
were quite friendly with her at the island&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I don't want to talk about the
island all the evening. There are some widows I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
would consider; but when it comes to orphans&mdash;orphan
teachers&mdash;count me out."</p>

<p>He smiled the gleeful smile, and Kathleen
sighed, and allotted him to the maiden of his
choice; one who knew and hated the enthralling
Mrs. Larrabee, and who, he averred, had enough
"pep" not to bore him.</p>

<p>Violet had somehow expected to be placed
with Edgar at dinner, and argue with herself
as she would, the surprise of finding herself with
a stranger instead gave her the sensation of a
slight; but she was cheery and natural, and her
escort, a youth with long lashes and a sallow
complexion, found the sea-blue eyes intelligent
and sympathetic repositories for his mournful
rhapsodies upon Kathleen Fabian's charms.</p>

<p>She was sitting across the table from them
beside Philip Sidney. Aqua-marines glistened
water-blue about her bare throat, and filmy
lace clung to her satin shoulders. Her simple
coiffure was in contrast to the puffs and curls
that danced airily on the other girlish heads.
Kathleen's was straight hair, but fine, thick,
and lustrous. The simplicity of her aspect gave
one to know that with her "the colors seen by
candlelight" would look the same by day.</p>

<p>"It isn't every one who understands Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
Fabian," the long lashes announced to Violet,
with the implication that he was in the inner
circle. "She's what I call a subtle girl&mdash;a
mysterious girl. Those jewels suit her. That
liquid, elusive play of light, as the moonlight
sparkles on the water, is like her moods,
gentle, and&mdash;and remote. I often think Miss
Fabian lives in a world of her own. One can't
always be sure that she hears what one is saying."</p>

<p>"I know her very little," returned Violet,
"but she does seem a very thoughtful girl."</p>

<p>"Who is that chap with her?&mdash;the big
fellow?"</p>

<p>"That is her cousin, Mr. Sidney."</p>

<p>"Her cousin? I never saw him before."</p>

<p>"I fancy he's not a New Yorker," said
Violet. "He is here studying art."</p>

<p>"H'm," ejaculated Long-Lashes. "He doesn't
look the part. He doesn't wear artistic hair."</p>

<p>"No," agreed Violet. "There is no studied
disorder in his appearance. Miss Fabian seems
to hear everything <em>he</em> says," she added demurely;
"and why, if he is her cousin, does she
call him Mr. Sidney?"</p>

<p>Long-Lashes, who had looked cheered at the
information of relationship, gloomed again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm sure I have it right," went on Violet.
"Mrs. Fabian told me he was her nephew."</p>

<p>"Oh," returned her companion, "but Mrs.
Fabian is Kathleen's step-mother." He looked
across at the pair anxiously. "She has adopted
him, though, that's evident. Her wits haven't
gone wool-gathering since we sat down."</p>

<p>When the young people returned to the
drawing-room they found a charming transformation
had taken place. The spacious floor
was bare, garlands of evergreen, holly, and
mistletoe were wreathed in all possible positions,
and a majestic Christmas tree sparkling
with the tiny electric bulbs of these sophisticated
days stood in a recess. Its boughs were
gay with favors for a german.</p>

<p>An orchestra, concealed behind palms in the
hall, played a Christmas carol as the couples
entered.</p>

<p>"There are Christmas fairies even in
Gotham," said Phil to Kathleen. "Ah," he
thought, "poverty may be no disgrace, but
what a convenience is money!" "Before we go
any further," he added aloud, "I want to thank
you, Miss Fabian, for the honor you paid the
stranger in a strange land by allowing me to
take you out to dinner. I want you to know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
that I appreciate it in a gathering of your own
friends."</p>

<p>Kathleen's calm eyes met his. She was
glad he could not know that she had expected
to champion his crude appearance in a gathering
where clothes went far to make the
man.</p>

<p>"I never thought of doing anything else,"
she returned; then added, smiling, "You know
I owed you hospitality."</p>

<p>"Brave girl," returned Phil, "to dare to refer
to that ill-starred day. I should never have had
the courage."</p>

<p>"Do you ever hear from Eliza?" asked
Kathleen.</p>

<p>"I received one letter after her arrival. It
was mostly about her cat, Pluto. She said he
acted like an imp of darkness."</p>

<p>"Why wouldn't he&mdash;saddled with that
name?" returned Kathleen.</p>

<p>Phil watched the aqua-marines sparkle and
dissolve on the whiteness of her neck.</p>

<p>"Your mother did to my stable what the
brownies have done here while we were dining.
Did she tell you?"</p>

<p>"She told me she bought you a few things."</p>

<p>"That is a modest way to put it. Will you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
come to tea with her some day this week and
see for yourself?"</p>

<p>"I shall be glad to. I've not been able to
remember you as being very comfortable."</p>

<p>The carol ceased. The odor of evergreen was
fresh as the forest itself. The orchestra began
a waltz.</p>

<p>"I wonder if he can dance," thought Kathleen,
in her ignorance of the West. The evening
clothes were promising but she had her doubts
of Terpsichore west of the Rockies. She little
knew that in dress clothes or sweater the cowboy
leads the world in dancing.</p>

<p>The music was irresistible and in a moment
she was floating away in the waltz.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" she thought with a mixture of
consternation and satisfaction. "I've taken the
best of everything!"</p>

<p>Edgar cast a glance after them. "A duck
to the water," he thought. A touch of nature
makes the whole world kin; and when Phil
arrived to-night, that unique dress tie of his had
suffered damage from his overcoat. Edgar with
lofty hospitality had supplied the lack. It had
given him a foretaste of self-satisfaction as
patron of the arts, and he now felt quite benevolently
glad to find that Phil was not going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
to entangle Kathleen's feet, as he sailed off
with his own partner, humming the waltz in
her appreciative ear.</p>

<p>Long-Lashes danced as he talked, with poetic
meditation. Violet had no objection to him, but
she was conscious of Edgar's every movement.
If he did not ask her for the next dance she
would not give him any, even if she had to
sprain her ankle.</p>

<p>However, the catastrophe was averted, because
he did ask her for the second, and, joy of
joys, she could not give it to him; for as she
and Long-Lashes crept near Kathleen and Phil
during the waltz, Phil, prompted by his partner,
raised his eyebrows in a request.</p>

<p>"The next, Miss Manning?"</p>

<p>She nodded assent; and so it was that Edgar
took the third; and as soon as he joined her
asked her opinion of Phil's dancing.</p>

<p>"Of course you're authority," he added
tactfully, as they started.</p>

<p>"Oh, I quite forgot shop while I was with
him," said Violet coolly; "beside, I don't teach
ballroom dancing."</p>

<p>Edgar suspected that he had, in his own language,
put his foot in it; so he used his universal
panacea and sang the waltz in his partner's ear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pretty, isn't it? Say, you can dance, Miss
Manning, if you don't know how to teach it.
Watch me favor you in the german."</p>

<p>"Mr. Sidney is a perfect dancer," she said.</p>

<p>"He looks it. I'm mighty glad he doesn't
fall all over himself. He's a trifle too big to
make that safe; and being a wild Westerner I
didn't know just what he would do. Do you
ever do a jig nowadays?"</p>

<p>"Occasionally&mdash;in the way of business."</p>

<p>"Say," exclaimed Edgar with enthusiasm, as
he led her safely among the thickening couples,
"would you do one to-night if I clear the
floor?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," returned Violet, laughing.</p>

<p>"But you did at the island."</p>

<p>"I only jig on a vessel's deck," said the girl.</p>

<p>"And I have to wait till next summer?"</p>

<p>"Poor, poor fellow!" Violet's eyes looked up
into his pathetically. He had forgotten what
very nice eyes they were, and what jolly little
stars danced in their depths.</p>

<p>"I'd like to clog, and I believe I'd be a good
one. Do you teach it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then I'll enter the class!" declared Edgar
with enthusiasm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>"You're just a tiny bit over-age," said
Violet. "Fifteen's the limit."</p>

<p>"Then I'll come to your home, that's what
I'll do. I'll take private lessons."</p>

<p>"Impossible. There's no place to clog there
except on the table."</p>

<p>"But that's what I should prefer to any other
place."</p>

<p>"I'll teach you next summer," said Violet,
"and take my pay in song."</p>

<p>"That's proverbially cheap," said Edgar.</p>

<p>"Yes, '<em>a</em> song,' perhaps," returned Violet,
"but I shall exact dozens."</p>

<p>Edgar tossed his head with the gleeful smile.</p>

<p>"It's a bargain," he declared.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">SPRING</p>


<p>Spring came all too soon for Philip after his
gloriously solitary and absorbed winter.</p>

<p>One Saturday morning, even from his sunless
north window, it proclaimed itself and would
not be denied. The tint of the sky, the scanty
glimpses of waving green, and the jubilant song
of birds in the park, all spoke of the annual
miracle.</p>

<p>"Just the day for a sketch," thought Phil,
and buttoning his collar, he went to the head of
the stairs and called Pat.</p>

<p>"Here," responded the Irishman, "and sure
I wish it was there, thin."</p>

<p>"Where's that?"</p>

<p>"Annywhere in the country-side where I
couldn't see a pavement the day."</p>

<p>"Just what I was thinking, Pat. I'm going
to borrow the key to the park again. I wonder if
you'd go over to Streeter's on Fourth Avenue
for me. You remember the place you bought
the framed Madonna for your sister. I'd like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
you to get a package of materials they were to
have sent me yesterday. I don't want to miss a
minute of this weather for a sketch, and I can
be making my coffee while you're gone."</p>

<p>"Sure I will. I've got to go that way for a
pair o' boots annyway."</p>

<p>"If I get a good sketch," called Phil after
him, "you may look at it for nothing."</p>

<p>Pat was privately not at all sure that it would
be worth looking at, even if the artist thought it
good. He had seen a number of Phil's efforts
which looked like nothing to him, and the artist's
explanation that they were merely impressions
did not bring them within Pat's comprehension
as being worth the paper they spoiled.
Nevertheless his devotion to the artist was
steadfast and he hastened on his errand.</p>

<p>Phil ate his breakfast, and primed two canvases
for the Monday pose. Then his Streeter
package having arrived, he hurriedly transferred
a few pieces of charcoal and some pans
of water-color to his sketch-box, and was off
down the stable steps into the mellow light of
spring, the park key in his hand.</p>

<p>"What a morning!" he thought, as he passed
through the gate and snapped the lock after
him. At different times when he had visited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
this enclosure with his scratch-pad, he had
made mental notes of advantageous points for
sketching, and he now moved straight to a
chosen spot.</p>

<p>The gravel path winding between the patches
of fresh spring green crunched under his feet
and reminded him of the tar and pebble roof he
had put on a barn in Montana. How different
this life! How glorious! If only his mother
could sit beside him while he sketched this
morning.</p>

<p>The day was joyous as his spirit, and the park
was soon alive with children and their capped
and aproned nurses, truly distinguished in their
right of eminent domain, while outside the
hedges and railings sauntered those with no
proprietary rights in Gramercy Park. A child
often peeped through the fence at coveted dandelions,
like a little peri at the gates of paradise.</p>

<p>Phil worked away, paying no attention to the
more inquisitive youngsters who dared from a
well-bred distance to stretch and strain for a
look at what was being done in art.</p>

<p>He was hastily washing in a soft rose grey
that was eventually to take the form of several
charming old brick houses. They had dormer
windows above and fascinating iron grilled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
balconies with long drawing-room windows and
great masses of spring flowers growing in front
of the basements.</p>

<p>Philip was working with an intensity of interest
and absorption, and suddenly he threw a
quantity of color and water from his brush with
a quick backward motion which sent a flood
over one of the youngsters who had ventured
quite near. A shout of glee went up from the
others of the group and he turned quickly to see
what had happened, just as a girl, not capped
or aproned, seized the little color-target, and
wiped the moisture from the boy's face with her
handkerchief.</p>

<p>"You, Miss Manning!" cried the artist, "and
I can't spare time to rise and fall on my knees in
apology."</p>

<p>"Ernest is the one who should apologize,"
said Violet, laughing, "but you know an artist
out of doors is common property."</p>

<p>"Of course," returned Phil, washing away
industriously. "Come here, little chap. I'm
sorry I doused you. Come and see what I'm
doing&mdash;no, not the rest of you. I can't have a
heavy weight on my sword arm."</p>

<p>Upon this, Ernest, who had been scarlet
under his companions' amusement, gave them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
a glance of superiority and moved to Phil's
side.</p>

<p>"What's that?" he asked, pointing to the
object in the sketch which had been the cause of
the present smooches on his blouse.</p>

<p>"What?" asked Phil encouragingly.</p>

<p>"That big tall thing that looks kind of rough,
like a rock or something."</p>

<p>"Why, that's the Metropolitan Tower. See
it there over those roofs?" Phil directed the
boy's gaze with his brush-handle.</p>

<p>"Doesn't look much like it, does it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you wait and see."</p>

<p>"Are those going to be trees there?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and those spots are going to be filled
with red and pink and yellow and white. You
know what a tulip is? Those are the tulip beds."</p>

<p>Ernest leaned comfortably against the green
park bench. "What are you going to make the
picture for?"</p>

<p>"Enough questions," said Violet brightly.
She was standing away a little, but mounting
guard over her small charge and taking notes of
the sketch for the benefit of Rex. Now she
stepped forward and took the child's hand with
intent to lead him away; but Phil looked smiling
at the boy, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm going to try to paint this picture so that
when any one studies it he will get its message
and feel as I do to-day."</p>

<p>The child looked back into the man's eyes,
and discerned a fellow child.</p>

<p>"Is it your birthday?" he asked gravely.</p>

<p>Phil laughed softly. "I shouldn't wonder,"
he answered. "What made you think so?"</p>

<p>"You look happy&mdash;and you said&mdash;" the
boy didn't finish, and Phil nodded.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see a chrysalis, Ernest? Well,
I think I've been expanding all winter. I feel
sort of wingy this morning. This is a good sort
of day for a chrysalis to burst, don't you think
so? Perhaps this <em>is</em> my birthday and you
guessed it before I did."</p>

<p>"Come, Ernest, we must go," said Violet,
smiling. "We're a load on the butterfly's
wings."</p>

<p>"Do you live here in the park, Miss Manning?"</p>

<p>"No. I spent last night with a friend here,
and one of the maids fell ill, so Ernest and I
thought we could walk about a bit and smell
the lilacs."</p>

<p>"I don't want to go away," said Ernest. "I
like to see him paint."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just move some of that paraphernalia from
the end of the bench and sit down, can't you,
Miss Manning?" suggested Phil. "I piled it
there in self-defence, but it's for show. Keep
away from my arm, old man, and you may
watch me all you like."</p>

<p>"Come here, Ernest, you can see just as
well," and Violet, seating herself, drew the child
against her knee.</p>

<p>The scent of moist lilacs was in the air.</p>

<p>"There's a robin," cried Ernest&mdash;"oh, two!
Look."</p>

<p>"Quiet, don't frighten them," said Violet, as
the bright-eyed birds ran beneath the bushes.</p>

<p>"Put them in, won't you, Mr.&mdash;&mdash;" began
the child eagerly.</p>

<p>"That is Mr. Sidney, Ernest," said Violet.
"It is time you were introduced and this is
Ernest Tremaine, Mr. Sidney."</p>

<p>"I'll make you a sketch of the robin in a
minute."</p>

<p>One of the birds ran toward the seated group,
and stood a moment, proud and high-chested,
his sleek head gleaming in the sun. Phil
laughed to himself as his busy hand worked.</p>

<p>"What are you laughing at?" asked the little
boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>"Cock robin. He reminded me of somebody
I know. Don't you think he looks very pleased
with his red vest and his smooth feathers?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the child. "Perhaps it's his
birthday, too." He laughed, delighted that his
big friend was amused.</p>

<p>"Perhaps; and see there! He has found a
birthday present."</p>

<p>The robin had suddenly pounced upon a worm
and was digging it from its earthy stronghold.</p>

<p>Violet had to put her hand over the child's
mouth to still his mirth. The bird was sitting
on his tail, claws dug in the ground as he leaned
back, dragging at his prey.</p>

<p>"How good of the robins to stray away from
Central Park, and bring spring to all these little
places," said Violet. "I heard one last night.
Perhaps this is the very fellow. Their notes
always make me think of links in a chain, link
after link, alike, yet so fresh. Wouldn't it be
great, Ernest, if this pair are hunting for a place
to build here, and would take a tree that you
could see from your windows, and you could
watch them with an opera-glass?"</p>

<p>"Do you think they will?" The child looked
up into the golden-green of tender new leaves
through which the mellow light was sifting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>"We must ask them to hurry up," said Violet,
"before the foliage grows heavy and makes
it hard to watch them."</p>

<p>"What news from the island, Miss Manning?"
asked Phil.</p>

<p>"Oh, spring is peeping in on them, too, once
in a while. Aunt Amy says their hill will soon
be white with strawberry blossoms, and blue
with violets."</p>

<p>"And what of my friend, Eliza Brewster? I
believe you told me you have never seen her."</p>

<p>"Aunt Amy always speaks of her in her
letters. She has been a great comfort to them,
so helpful and kind."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Fabian will have it that I am to see
this wonderful island."</p>

<p>"You should go. It would be paradise for an
artist."</p>

<p>"And how about yourself?" asked Phil.
"You also have an aunt and a home on that
green mound I hear about."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm going for the whole summer,"
replied Violet. "I had two weeks last year, and
it created an inordinate appetite."</p>

<p>"Then you knew the Fabians there."</p>

<p>"Yes, a little. In two weeks one doesn't
make much headway with a girl like Kathleen."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is she difficult for a girl, too?" asked
Phil.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;at least for a new girl. She reminds
me of a series of locked doors. You succeed
in unlocking one, and the small room
within merely leads to another door. You must
strive to unlock that, and you succeed only to
find another waiting. Such wholesome, clean,
airy rooms, but small&mdash;always small. She is
fascinating to me, perhaps for that very reason.
Did you ever notice that even her hair is
reserved?"</p>

<p>Phil smiled, as his busy hand worked.
"Christmas night is the only time I ever saw
her with her hat off," he answered. "I'm afraid
you're too subtle for me."</p>

<p>"Oh, you'll see," said Violet; "an artist
couldn't help seeing in the daytime. What
color do you think it is?"</p>

<p>"Dark brown."</p>

<p>"I knew you would say that. Wait till you
see her in the sunshine. It's almost red; and
that's just like her. Even her hair keeps everything
to itself as long as it can."</p>

<p>Phil laughed. "Quite different from brother,
eh?"</p>

<p>"You mean that he is frank?" asked Violet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
with a perceptible indrawing of her own
frankness.</p>

<p>"Well, that's a mild word for it," answered
Phil. "I don't know Edgar's family crest, but
the inscription should read, freely translated,
'I give myself away.'"</p>

<p>The speaker laughed at his own folly, and
glanced up for sympathy. The baby bachelor's
full lips were grave and her eyes a little
dark.</p>

<p>"I like people to be frank," she said briefly.</p>

<p>Phil drew his own lips together in a noiseless
whistle and his eyes twinkled at the Metropolitan
Tower in the sketch.</p>

<p>"Keep off the grass," he mused. "I thought
you said reserve fascinated you," he remarked
aloud, mildly.</p>

<p>"One thing I don't like Mr. Fabian to reserve,"
said Violet, "and that is his voice."</p>

<p>"Great, isn't it?" agreed Phil. "I was glad
he sang for us Christmas night."</p>

<p>"Oh, I supposed you had heard him many
times. If he were my cousin I would give him
no rest."</p>

<p>"He's not mine, you see. I'm only a step-relation,
and such a long step!"</p>

<p>Violet bit her lip and looked at the speaker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
reflectively. She felt there was no rhyme or
reason in his amused expression.</p>

<p>"Then, that is why you haven't seen Miss
Kathleen's hair in the daylight," she said.
"Have you discovered her locked doors?"</p>

<p>"She let me into her ballroom, at Christmas,
and I think I must have been so pleased with
that I didn't try to get any further."</p>

<p>"I see," returned Violet. "Well, if you go to
the island you'll have a chance to explore.
Of course your experience with her may be
different from mine. Perhaps an artist will
have the open sesame to her doors. I'm not a
bit intellectual. I have to dance my way into
people's confidence, or I don't get there."</p>

<p>"I hear you teach that very pretty art."</p>

<p>"She teaches me," put in Ernest, who was
tired of being left out of the conversation. "I
can dance a jig."</p>

<p>"Bully for you," said Phil. "Go ahead, right
here on the path."</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't without any music."</p>

<p>"There's the music." Phil pointed with his
brush-handle to a lofty branch where the robin
was pouring forth linked sweetness, long drawn-out.</p>

<p>"The pebbles are too rolly," said the child.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
"You said you'd make me a picture of the
robin."</p>

<p>"So I did."</p>

<p>Phil pulled toward him another block of
paper and swiftly washed in the green of the
lilac bush and its purple pendants. Before it,
on a little stretch of green sward, grew the
robin, high-chested, alert.</p>

<p>"How proud he looks!" said the child,
delighted.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is saying: 'I own the earth, and the
worms therein.'" The artist laughed to himself.
"'If a worm shows his head, I gobble him up!
and I can sing as beautifully as I gobble. The
world stops to watch and listen. I am cock
robin! Look at me!'"</p>

<p>Artist and child laughed together as Phil
handed over the wet sketch to the eager little
hands. Violet's eyes were glued to it. She was
wondering if later she could make a surreptitious
purchase of it for Rex.</p>

<p>"I had heard of you before Christmas," she
said. "One of my housemates goes to your art
school. Regina Morris."</p>

<p>Phil shook his head. "I've not met any of
the girls. Are you a housekeeper?"</p>

<p>"Three of us live together in a tiny apart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>ment.
I wish you might come to see us sometime."</p>

<p>Phil looked up with his frank smile. "I'll call
on you at the island if you'll let me, and if I
come&mdash;that last is such a big If, though Mrs.
Fabian is determined."</p>

<p>"Oh, then you'll go. I've seen enough of
Mrs. Fabian to know that."</p>

<p>"Then it must be but for a week or two. I
mustn't stay where I can't work."</p>

<p>"You'll stay," nodded Violet. "You'll live
under a rock if necessary and catch fish for
food."</p>

<p>"Are you so enthusiastic?"</p>

<p>"Isn't everybody?"</p>

<p>"Nobody, that I have heard. Eliza spoke of
it like facing grim death. Edgar says it gives
him the 'Willies,' whatever they may be. Aunt
Isabel goes because her husband wants to sail."</p>

<p>"Did Mr. Fabian say it gave him the 'Willies'?"
asked Violet, her cheeks rose and her
eyes dark again. "Why does he go, then?"</p>

<p>"I didn't ask him; but a bare hill lying in a
wet fog doesn't sound inviting even if one may
occasionally catch a glimpse of the sea. You
know the sea and I are strangers."</p>

<p>"Did Kathleen talk to you about it?" asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
Violet, the hurt spot in her pride still smarting,
as memory showed her pictures of waves sparkling
in moonlight, and song that turned the
scene into enchantment.</p>

<p>"No, I believe we never mentioned the summer.
She talked to me of college and I talked to
her of my one dissipation of the autumn, an
evening over there at the Players' Club,"&mdash;Phil
nodded over his shoulder toward the club
windows,&mdash;"and the wit and wisdom I heard."</p>

<p>"I judge you have friends in the park," said
Violet.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have a work-room over here," replied
Phil vaguely. His wits were about him
when he contemplated the disconcerting possibility
of Ernest's sturdy little legs finding
their way up his stable stair.</p>

<p>"I want to show this to mother," said the
child, gloating over his sketch. Phil had used no
anmic colors in that. The lilacs were of a generous
purple, the robin's vest a royal red. When
he had thanked the artist and they had parted,
Ernest prattled of his treasure as he walked on
beside Violet.</p>

<p>"He's a proud bird," he said, half-soliloquizing
after his kind. "He wants the world to
listen when he sings; and his eyes are so bright,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
when he sees a worm coming along he gobbles
him quick, and then he looks prouder than
ever."</p>

<p>Violet's thoughts were busy, and somewhat
gloomy. Edgar had spoken patronizingly to her
of the big Western artist who had fallen into
their family circle.</p>

<p>Of whom was Phil thinking that gave him so
much amusement while he sketched the robin?</p>

<p>Violet was not sure whether her mental disturbance
was more resentment toward the
artist, or hurt that Edgar Fabian should declare
that he had been bored at the island.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">JUNE</p>


<p>During the long winter a strong bond of friendship
grew between Mrs. Wright and Eliza
Brewster. The latter's broken heart seemed to
heal in the very act of caring for the exiled lady,
and in the consolation of knowing that her own
familiarity with the island, and with all domestic
cares, gave daily return for the unspeakable
benefit of her home.</p>

<p>Upon Mr. Wright she looked from the first
with a reflective and judicial eye. He was Mrs.
Wright's husband, and that fact made Eliza
rigidly careful to do her duty by him; but mentally
she classified the adopted islander as a lazy
man who had all his days been looking for a soft
spot and who had been irresistibly drawn to the
freedom and irresponsibility of a life which permitted
him to wear a nglige shirt during the
semi-hibernation of the winter, and made no
demands upon him beyond an occasional arising,
by request, from the lounge to shovel snow-paths
and bring in fuel, and at evening to play<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
checkers with Captain James until an early
bedtime.</p>

<p>He liked Eliza's cooking and her nimble,
quiet ways, and externally they were at peace;
but Captain James's shrewd eyes often read
Eliza's suppressed impatience. One spring
morning, when he met her in the island road, he
attempted a mild protest in favor of the master
of the house.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wright's a clever feller," he said
argumentatively. "What's wrong with him,
Eliza?"</p>

<p>"What have I said about him?" she snapped.</p>

<p>"Don't you suppose I got eyes?" asked
Captain James.</p>

<p>Eliza was startled. She must put even
greater guard upon herself.</p>

<p>"Now, I ain't a-goin' to talk about him,
James. I s'pose it's all right for a great hulk of
a man to own a dainty city woman and take her
away from her friends and mew her up on a
snow-bank to suit his convenience."</p>

<p>"What you goin' back on the island for?"
inquired Captain James.</p>

<p>"I ain't goin' back on it. I'm island folks. I
find there is something, after all, in this talk
about native air."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's treated you all right," agreed the other,
regarding her countenance critically. "You've
dropped off five years this winter. Come summer
you'll shed ten more, like enough, and look
like you ought to look, Eliza. You ain't any old
woman."</p>

<p>Eliza ignored the blandishment.</p>

<p>"I can see in the glass I look better," she
returned impersonally, "and it makes me mad
to think it's all because I live in the house with
a sacrifice. Supposin' I'd come back to this
island alone."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Wright don't act like any sacrifice,"
protested Captain James; "she's chipper as a
canary bird."</p>

<p>"Of course she is. That's the kind of a wife a
man like that's sure to get. It's been my lot in
life, James, to live with angels," added Eliza
fiercely. "Can you tell me why I should be just
as cantankerous as ever?"</p>

<p>Captain James laughed. "Mebbe there's as
much truth in that talk about original sin as
there is about native air," he returned. "You
always was a limb, Eliza."</p>

<p>She smiled reluctantly. "I warned her before
I came," she returned, grave again. "I told her
I was bad, and <em>set</em>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>"But you couldn't scare her, eh?"</p>

<p>"Nobody could do that. She ain't afraid of
anything above ground. 'T ain't fear makes her
yield to Lazy-Bones there; and when she sets
out to make him do something he don't want
to, she gets him every time." Eliza's eyes wandered
to a cottage by the roadside. "There's
Betsy Eaton watchin' us. I expect she's wonderin'
why we're standin' in the wet so long.
Well, I've blown off steam and I'll run home.
I s'pose you'll be comin' up to-night to move
those little pieces o' wood around."</p>

<p>"Sure thing, Eliza," returned Captain James
with a grin. "Lemme teach you the game so
you can play it with him times when I don't
come."</p>

<p>In the speaker's own parlance he was trying
to "get a rise" out of his old friend; and he
succeeded. Eliza's eyes flashed almost with the
fire of youth.</p>

<p>"I'd throw 'em at him. I know I would&mdash;every
checker of 'em."</p>

<p>"Well, he'll be fishin' again soon," laughed
Captain James soothingly, "now his new boat's
about done."</p>

<p>"H'm!" grunted Eliza; and with no other
form of farewell, she started to trudge up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
hill toward home. The earth was moist and
yielding; the chill spring was here, and nature
was drawing her green paint-brush over the
high wave of the bluff. Little star-flowers
bloomed under her energizing kisses, and
shivered bravely when the east wind blew.</p>

<p>This morning the sun fell with sufficient
warmth on the stone step for Pluto to lie there,
and blink at the first sparrow he had seen. On
the whole, Eliza's move away from New York
had his entire approval. The change from the
restrictions of a city flat to this place was in
itself a delight, and far from agreeing with
Eliza's estimation of the master of the house he
found him quite the most sensible human being
he had ever encountered. One who appreciated
a soft lounge when he saw it, and who always
made room for a cat, and never disturbed his
slumbers with precipitate movement. Eliza
watched their growing intimacy with grim
amusement.</p>

<p>"Birds of a feather flock together," was
frequently her mental comment.</p>

<p>As the spring unfolded, and the early mornings
were less chill, Mr. Wright again took up
his suspended practice of making sunrise visits
to his pond. At first Pluto considered this a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
foolish practice; but at last he learned to connect
it with attractive pieces of fish which came his
way, and again he paid tribute of admiration to
the hand which always discriminated so nicely
just which point back of his ears should be
scratched in order to establish the most friendly
relations.</p>

<p>Eliza's threat that he should reside in the
chicken-house had come to naught, for it had
required but a few days for Pluto to recover
from the savagery to which his novel contact
with Mother Earth at first reduced him; and he
again became a domestic animal full of content
in the equally novel petting which now fell to
his share.</p>

<p>One day Eliza with amused memory of her
childish terrors pushed open the door of the
forlorn chicken-house, and looked in; but one
look was enough. She closed it again quickly on
the dirt and cobwebs. Its small windows were
opaque with the dust of years. It was almost
picturesque with its leaking roof which had
once been red, huddling close to earth under
the protection of those hardy old warriors, the
balm-of-Gilead trees.</p>

<p>"If 'twas mine," mused Eliza, as she
withdrew from the dirt and damp of the close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
interior, "I'd clean it with a good fire. It's
hopeless."</p>

<p>A sparrow lit on the despised roof, and
poured a song toward the sea.</p>

<p>"That's so," said Eliza looking up at the tiny
creature with a smile. "It <em>is</em> spring. It's a
wonder to be in a place where there ain't one
o' your English cousins."</p>

<p>She turned and nearly trod on Pluto. His
green eyes were fixed on the bird. His lithe
body crouched in the fresh grass and quivered
along its length in the intensity of his upward
gaze.</p>

<p>"Pluto Brewster!" she exclaimed in desperation.
"Supposin' you ever should catch a bird
up here!" She stooped and boxed his ears. He
laid them back and, blinking the eager eyes,
crouched lower.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wright on her doorstep saw Eliza approaching,
the cat under her arm.</p>

<p>"He was lookin' at a sparrow," announced
Eliza.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wright laughed. "I've heard that a cat
may look even at a king," she said.</p>

<p>"If Pluto should kill birds!" exclaimed his
owner desperately.</p>

<p>"Would you, little tiger?" asked Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
Wright, closing her hand over the cat's face and
giving it a little shake.</p>

<p>Pluto was beginning to consider that women
were a sad mistake. He struggled to get free
and Eliza dropped him.</p>

<p>"How the spring has stolen past us," said
Mrs. Wright. "Do you realize Eliza that even
June is moving on its way? Look over there at
the Fabian cottage."</p>

<p>"Why that's James out on the veranda."</p>

<p>"Yes, he has had a letter from Mrs. Fabian.
She wants him to open the house. To-day is
Kathleen Fabian's Commencement."</p>

<p>"That's so," said Eliza coolly. "You showed
me the invitation."</p>

<p>"It was rather nice of her to remember me,
way off here, and little as I know them."</p>

<p>"I guess Kathleen would be an agreeable
enough girl if she was let alone," said Eliza.</p>

<p>She had for some time now given up anxiety
lest the high words over the barrel in Phil's
studio bear bad fruit for him; for a letter had
set her mind at rest on that score, and she felt
instinctively that she had Kathleen Fabian to
thank for that.</p>

<p>"But any girl would be slow to cut off
friendly relations with a feller like Mr. Sid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>ney,"
she considered, prejudice still holding her
in a strong grasp.</p>

<p>"So they're comin'," said Eliza, in a lifeless
voice. The winter had been very happy. She
began to long for the fall.</p>

<p>"Yes, very soon."</p>

<p>"Is your niece comin' with 'em?"</p>

<p>"No; she will keep busy until July." Mrs.
Wright drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>"Oh, how lovely this is, Eliza," she went on.
"This morning makes me think of Stopford
Brooke's lines,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">'A little sun, a little rain,</div>
    <div class="verse">A soft wind blowing from the West&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse">And woods and fields are sweet again,</div>
    <div class="verse">And the warmth within the mountain's breast.'</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Our mountain&mdash;what a height we should see
we had if that sea could roll back; we can feel
the warmth in its breast this morning, and the
lovely miracles it is putting forth. Why don't
you look happier, Eliza?" Mrs. Wright smiled
as she asked the question. Her friend's eyes
were gloomily following the movements of
Captain James in the distance as he beat rugs
on the grass beside the boulder cottage.</p>

<p>"I guess you know why," rejoined Eliza
briefly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>"The idea of letting anybody rob you of
your happiness," said Mrs. Wright. "I shall
have to put Marcus Aurelius side of your bed
so you can read him before you go to sleep.
I thought you were more of a philosopher,
Eliza."</p>

<p>"You ain't half through your disappointments
in me yet," returned Eliza drily.</p>

<p>"Ho!" exclaimed Mrs. Wright, resting her
hand on the shoulder of her companion as she
stood a step below her. "I haven't begun on
them yet."</p>

<p>"Just s'posin'," said Eliza, looking about at
the fair prospect, "that Mrs. Ballard could be
with us to see the summer comin'. How comfortable
we'd make her!"</p>

<p>"I don't believe she'd come," said Mrs.
Wright gently, "as much as she loves us."</p>

<p>"That's what he said," returned Eliza musingly.
"He said we hadn't ought to believe we
could make her happier than she is."</p>

<p>"He? Who?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Sidney."</p>

<p>"Good for the boy," said Mrs. Wright, who
had heard so much and often about Philip that
she felt as if she had met him.</p>

<p>"Why can't we go on here just as we have,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
said Eliza regretfully. "Why must folks
come?"</p>

<p>"Listen to the grudging one!" exclaimed
Mrs. Wright lightly. "And what a different
doctrine Nature is preaching us this morning.
Look where you will, no limitations&mdash;none.
Illimitable sky, illimitable sea. That's the way
it should be in our hearts, Eliza, illimitable
love."</p>

<p>"I dare say," returned the other with a world
of obstinacy in her tone.</p>

<p>"The world can't be full of Mrs. Ballards,
but they're all our brothers and sisters just the
same. Mr. Brooke goes on in his verse to say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">'A little love, a little trust,</div>
    <div class="verse">A soft impulse, a sudden dream,</div>
    <div class="verse">And life as dry as desert dust</div>
    <div class="verse">Is fresher than a mountain stream,'</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>I don't like that hard look to come in your eyes,
Eliza. The feeling behind it turns life as dry as
desert dust wherever it holds sway."</p>

<p>"I told you&mdash;" began Eliza slowly.</p>

<p>"I know all about that," interrupted Mrs.
Wright, "but little by little you'll find that all
hard wilfulness is flat, stale, and unprofitable.
Now you'd better spend this week before the
Fabians come in trying that recipe every time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
you think of them. 'A little love, a little trust,
a soft impulse.'"</p>

<p>"And what will Mrs. Fabian be doin' all
that time?" asked Eliza hardily. "Do you
suppose she'll have any soft impulses toward me
until I give her her aunt's things? That barrel
upstairs in the back bedroom has got her grandmother's
china and silver in it."</p>

<p>"What do you want of it, Eliza?" asked Mrs.
Wright.</p>

<p>"To keep it away from her," was the prompt
reply; and the speaker saw a cloud pass over the
eyes she had learned to love. "Anyway, Mrs.
Wright," she went on earnestly, "she left 'em
all to me, all her things, Mrs. Ballard did."</p>

<p>"I see," said Mrs. Wright thoughtfully.
"Doubtless her grateful heart longed to leave
you her money, and deciding to do otherwise
she felt she wished you to have something
equivalent."</p>

<p>While they talked, Captain James had
started across the field toward them, and now
he drew near, walking beneath the bold and
intricate curves made by wheeling swallows, the
deep blue of their backs flashing iridescent in
the sunlight.</p>

<p>"Say," he called, "these fellers have set up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
housekeepin' over there in the Fabian porch.
Snug as bugs in rugs they are. Darned if I
know what to do."</p>

<p>"Who?&mdash;the swallows?" asked Mrs. Wright.</p>

<p>"Yes." Captain James seated himself on a
rustic bench in the sun. "It's the new wind-break
they had put up last summer did the mischief.
Always been too blowy other springs for
'em to try it."</p>

<p>"You dislike to disturb them? Is that the
trouble?" asked Mrs. Wright.</p>

<p>"I dislike to get my head took off," returned
Captain James. "Mrs. Fabian'll have the law
on me if I don't knock the nest down and clean
up, and Kathleen'll read me the riot act if I
do."</p>

<p>The speaker pushed his hat to one side and
scratched his head.</p>

<p>Eliza regarded him unsmiling.</p>

<p>"Do you always take care of their cottage?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"Ever since they've had one," he answered.
"Used to take Kathleen and Edgar out to my
pound when they wa'n't knee high to a grasshopper."</p>

<p>"And now she has graduated from college.
Think of it," said Mrs. Wright.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wa'n't I invited?" asked Captain James
proudly. "I guess I was. All engraved up
pretty, and Kathleen's card inside. When they
fledged Edgar and shoved him out o' the nest he
didn't remember me; but little sober-sides
there, she wa'n't goin' to forget an old friend.
Edgar's boots nor his hat don't exactly fit him,
late years," went on Captain James good-humoredly,
"but Kathleen always was a brick
and she ain't got over it. I guess I'll let the
swallers alone till she's had her say anyway."</p>

<p>"Going to be over there this afternoon, Captain
James?" asked Mrs. Wright.</p>

<p>"Yes. I've got Betsy Eaton washin' the
dishes and cleanin' now, and I'll be back again
on the rugs later."</p>

<p>"Let us go over, Eliza," said Mrs. Wright.
"I want you to see what a beautiful cottage it
is."</p>

<p>Eliza looked at her with steady significance.
"I'm goin' to be too busy," she said slowly.</p>

<p>Captain James sighed and rose. "Handsome
day," he remarked, as he trudged off to dinner.</p>

<p>"To-morrow, then?" asked Mrs. Wright.</p>

<p>"No," responded Eliza firmly, freed of Captain
James's presence, "nor the day after that.
I ain't double-faced, Mrs. Wright. I can't go in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
when they ain't there, if I wouldn't when they
are there."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wright laughed softly. "My square-toed
Eliza," she said, turning into the house.
"Oh, I forgot to say there's a letter for you
here. Mr. Wright must have left it on the
table."</p>

<p>Eliza had stooped over the row of sweet peas
coming up thriftily about the house, and she
rose slowly and followed her friend indoors,
but when she saw the small stubbed writing
on the envelope her eyes brightened. Twice
before during the winter had it come to cheer
her.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sidney!" she said, and sat down to
enjoy her letter to the full.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Eliza</span>," it began.</p>

<p>"We had a hot day yesterday. Pat's tongue
hung out and he assured me that the only thing
that would do him any good was to take off his
flesh and sit in his bones. They tell me the
summer is here to stay, and I am going to make
an aisle through my opposite neighbor, the
storeroom, and get at the window in there so as
to get a draught through. The sun bakes the
stable roof, but I wouldn't mind it if the perspiration
didn't run into my eyes. This state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
of things makes me an easy prey to Aunt Isabel's
kind insistence that I shall spend a week
with her. She says two; but that will depend on
how much fog there is and whether I have to
waste time.</p>

<p>"I can't compliment you on being a complete
letter-writer, but I judge you have had a good
winter and kept from freezing. You say the
islands have looked like frosted wedding cakes.
The first part sounds good to me. I hope you've
saved some over. That's the sort of wedding
cake I'd like to dream on just now. You may
believe my heart often goes homing to the
mountains. What would I give for one night
under the windy trees. The very stars are hot
here&mdash;but&mdash;I like it!</p>

<p>"I've had a wonderful winter. I can't say
I'm a belle at the Academy. One of the teachers
turned on me the other day and said he
would thank me to stop trying to teach him how
to teach me. He said my 'stand-and-deliver'
methods might be <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de rigueur</i> west of the Rockies,
but something less aggressive would be
more becoming a student here who knew as
little as I did. They all have a hunted look as
they come near me; for I don't care a straw how
much they snub me if I can only get from them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
what I'm after; and I glow with the consciousness
that I have accomplished a lot, even though
my strenuous path is strewn with the wounded
and I have some bruises myself.</p>

<p>"Dear Aunt Mary! I send her a wireless
every night. I wonder if she gets it!</p>

<p>"Aunt Isabel has been a trump to me the
whole winter, patient with my neglect, and letting
me go my own gait; but she brought a
thermometer over to the stable in my absence
one day and sat down in my room waiting for it
to go up. It didn't lag, and I found her sitting
there in a wilted state, and she declared that
she should stay until I promised to go with
her to the island and get a coat of tan. So I
promised. It will be great to get a breath, and
great to see you again, Eliza. Kindly arrange
that the third week in June shall be free from
fog. My time will be precious.</p>

<p>"Give my compliments to Mrs. Wright and
tell her I had a pleasant chat with her niece one
morning in the park while I was sketching.</p>

<p>"Tell Pluto to be ready to pose with you if
old ocean veils himself.</p>

<p>"With my best to you,</p>

<p class="right">
"As ever
<br />
"<span class="smcap">Philip Sidney</span>."
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, then, Eliza," said Mrs. Wright when
her companion had read this epistle aloud.</p>

<p>"Now, then, what?" returned Eliza happily.</p>

<p>"He'll be a link. He'll have to be. You can't
be crabbed and offish and spoil his one vacation."</p>

<p>"Do you mean Mrs. Fabian?" Eliza gave
her rare laugh as she pushed the letter back into
its envelope. "If she could help her nephew
from runnin' after common folks, she would;
but she certainly won't run after him. We
shan't clash any."</p>

<p>"I'm glad I'm going to see the boy," said
Mrs. Wright. Violet had written of him: at first
with girlish enthusiasm, but after the park interview
more grudgingly. It seemed rather silly
in a grown man to be so amused by the airs of a
robin! For some unknown reason the memory
of that foolishness had rankled for days.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">THE PEACEMAKER</p>


<p>Kathleen Fabian, out of school in that month
of June, was at home in body, but with her
mind still clinging about the scenes of her college
life.</p>

<p>"I do believe, all things considered," said
her mother when they were sitting alone one
morning over their coffee, "that I am against
college for girls!"</p>

<p>Kathleen looked up absent-mindedly from
the letter she had been reading. "What's the
matter?" she asked vaguely.</p>

<p>"You have scarcely heard a word I have
said since you came home," declared Mrs.
Fabian. "Your thoughts are a thousand miles
away all the time."</p>

<p>"Not a thousand," protested the girl. "Four
years is a long time, you know. To break up
one's home&mdash;to break all those ties&mdash;means
so much."</p>

<p>"Exactly what I say," retorted Mrs. Fabian.
"I should like to know when you will begin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
again to realize that this is home, and that your
father and mother would like some share in
your thoughts."</p>

<p>"Why, I must be horribly selfish," returned
the girl.</p>

<p>"There it is again!" exclaimed her mother,
increasingly nettled. "If it takes unselfishness
to show some interest in home after a girl leaves
college, I say she had better not go there."</p>

<p>"Very well," returned Kathleen, smiling.
"Don't you ever send another daughter; but
I'm glad you made the mistake with me. I've
been so happy, mother."</p>

<p>"Oh, well," returned Mrs. Fabian, somewhat
mollified by the wistfulness of the girl's look
and tone, "I suppose you have, and perhaps it
is all for the best; but hereafter, when I speak
to you, I intend to begin 'Kathleen Fabian!'
and you must reply 'Present' before I go on."</p>

<p>"Have you been talking to me?" asked
Kathleen navely.</p>

<p>"Well, rather. I have been telling you something
that should be very interesting, considering
the height of the thermometer. Father says
we are to start for the island next Wednesday;
and I am holding in my hand an acceptance from
Philip Sidney to my invitation to go with us."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>"How very nice," said Kathleen courteously.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian, always on the sensitive lookout
where her young relative was concerned, thought
she detected a perfunctory note.</p>

<p>"You knew I had asked him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think you did mention it before
Commencement."</p>

<p>"He says," said Mrs. Fabian, "that you
have never talked to him about the island."</p>

<p>"But think," returned Kathleen, "how seldom
I have talked with him."</p>

<p>"Yes," returned her mother resignedly, "and
how full your head is of other matters. You
were very nice to Phil on Christmas night, here.
I wasn't sure but that you would invite him
yourself."</p>

<p>"Oh, why should I?"</p>

<p>"No reason, if you don't see any. Phil was
very polite to you at your graduation. Those
flowers were exquisite."</p>

<p>"Yes." The girl smiled. "They would have
worried me, but that I know flowers are cheaper
in June."</p>

<p>"I don't think that's a very nice thing to
say," observed Mrs. Fabian.</p>

<p>"I meant it very nicely," returned Kathleen
mildly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, perhaps it isn't so strange that you
have not talked the island to him, since you
have been engrossed in other things; but I have
had all the trouble in the world to induce him
to go; and if you had roused his enthusiasm a
little it would have been easier."</p>

<p>"Why have you urged him?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>Her mother regarded her for a pause, in
exasperated silence. "Are you aware," she
returned at last, "that it is 87 in the shade this
morning? Are you aware that these rooms,
where the draught constantly changes the air,
are slightly different from that studio, baking
under a stable roof and hemmed in by high
buildings?"</p>

<p>"Of course, of course!"</p>

<p>"Are you aware," went on Mrs. Fabian
sonorously, "that one who has always previously
had a home might find a brief change
from cheap restaurants invigorating in hot
weather?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know," said Kathleen. "I thought
perhaps he was too busy to notice. He"&mdash;she
hesitated, but imperceptibly to Mrs. Fabian,&mdash;"he
has not called here since I returned."</p>

<p>"That's just it," flashed Phil's defender.
"He never spares himself. He thinks of nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
but work. Now, I have never forced any of my
relatives on the Fabians," with heightened
color, "but your father likes Phil. He was
delighted to have me ask him. He has charged
me to hold on to the boy until he can join
us."</p>

<p>"I hope he can stay," put in Kathleen
politely.</p>

<p>"If I can get him there," said Mrs. Fabian.
"Here is this matter of the berths, as usual.
The stateroom has been engaged for a month,
but we have only Molly's berth outside."</p>

<p>Kathleen's eyes grew eager. "Well, that's
all right," she said. "You won't mind taking
Molly in the stateroom in my place, and let
Mr. Sidney have her berth. I'll wait and come
up with father."</p>

<p>"You not go with us? Kathleen, you're
absurd." Color streamed again over Mrs.
Fabian's face.</p>

<p>"No, no. That will be a fine plan, and
relieve you of all embarrassment. Father will
like to have me here, and I shall love to stay
with him."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian gazed at the girl in silence. She
admired Kathleen extravagantly. There was
something in the girl's natural poise and ele<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>gance
which the stepmother, with an innate,
unacknowledged consciousness of inferiority,
worshipped. She never forgot that Kathleen's
mother had been a Van Ruysler. Now, as if it
were not enough that Edgar scorned the island,
and even if he should be granted leave of
absence would not play the courteous host to
Phil, now Kathleen was anxious to avoid him,
and caught at an excuse to postpone her departure.</p>

<p>The girl grew uncomfortable under the fixed
stare bent upon her, and when suddenly Mrs.
Fabian dropped her coffee-spoon and burying
her face in her hands burst into tears, Kathleen
arose in dismay, the soft laces of her nglige
floating in the breeze she made hastening around
the table and taking the weeping one in her
arms.</p>

<p>"I don't know what has happened," she said
in bewilderment, "but I am sure it is all my
fault. I was trying to help you, mother."</p>

<p>"You were not!" responded Mrs. Fabian, as
angrily as the softening nature of salt water
would permit. "You were trying to avoid that
poor, lonely little fellow."</p>

<p>Kathleen bit her lip as memory presented
the stalwart, self-confident artist before her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>"You tell me to take my young cousin if I
must, and get his visit over with before you
come up there to enjoy yourself. You don't
care how much you hurt his feelings."</p>

<p>"Why, mother, wouldn't he think it very
natural that I should keep father company?"</p>

<p>"No, certainly not, when he knows that
Edgar is here. He doesn't know that Edgar
isn't any use to anybody, unless it's Mrs.
Larrabee. He'd just think the truth: that you
don't want to be there at the same time he is."</p>

<p>"Now, mother, you're so mistaken. He
wouldn't even miss me. When he gets the view
from our porch he won't know whether I'm
there or not."</p>

<p>"Very convenient excuse; but you needn't
make any more of them. I understand you,
Kathleen. Why shouldn't I, when I taught
you to walk? I'm foolish to break down before
you. I ought to have more pride; but it's the
heat. I'm tired and nervous; and you come
home from college with no interest except in
what you've left behind you, and want to
arrange things so that my guest at the island
will have his visit spoiled&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mother, he&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nobody at the cottage but me, and nobody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
to help entertain him but Mrs. Wright and
Eliza Brewster and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mother, he&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's so often that I ask any of my friends
there! So often that I bore you and Edgar to
look out for my guests! I must always be on
hand for yours, to chaperone you and see that
all goes smoothly for your plans. I suppose&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mother, indeed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If Phil had sunstroke, it would be all the
same to you, just so he kept out of your way;
and Christmas week when we went there to tea,
how nice he was to us, and so amusing, getting
everything in such perfect order that he apologized
for not dusting the marshmallows. Oh,
my head is just bursting!"</p>

<p>"There, mother dear, I know you will be ill,
if you get so excited," said Kathleen, patting
the heaving white silken shoulder. "Of course,
I'll go to the island with you. I didn't know
you cared so much."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian lifted her swollen eyes to behold
her victory. "There's one comfort, Kathleen,"
she said, deep catches in her breath. "You
never do things by halves. If you do go, you'll
never allow Phil to feel that he bores you."</p>

<p>The girl smiled. "No, if I succeed in calling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
myself to his attention," she answered, "I
promise he shan't suspect it."</p>

<p>"If he is sometimes absent-minded," said
Mrs. Fabian defensively, "I'm sure I don't
know any one who should have so much sympathy
with him as you&mdash;the very queen of
wool-gatherers."</p>

<p>Kathleen laughed and went back to her seat
at the table. "I see that I must reform," she
replied.</p>

<p>"I'm relieved, and I do thank you," said her
mother; "but the question remains, how are
we going to get Phil there?"</p>

<p>"That's easy. Send Molly with the other
maids by the boat. I'll hook your gown."</p>

<p>"There," returned Mrs. Fabian; "you see,
you might have suggested that in the first
place. I understand you well enough, Kathleen."</p>

<p>"I thought it would be good fun to hob-nob
with father. It's so long since I have."</p>

<p>"I'm going to persuade him to leave business
early this year. It has worried him unusually
this winter. He can if he only thinks so. I
reminded him this morning that if he died, the
business would have to get on without him.
He agreed, but said in that case the loss would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
be wholly covered by insurance. Rather grim
sort of humor, that. I told him I couldn't see
anything funny in such talk."</p>

<p>"Poor father," commented Kathleen.
"Everybody is tired this time of year. There
should be some arrangement of relays in running
a business. The winter workers should be
turned out to grass in May."</p>

<p>She looked at her father that evening with
observant eyes, as together they moved into
his den after dinner. It had been closed from
the sun all day and he sank into a big leather
armchair by a breeze-blown window, following
his daughter's white-clad figure with appreciative
eyes.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you're through college, Kath,"
he said.</p>

<p>"So I can light your cigar the rest of my
life?" she asked, seating herself on his knee and
applying the lighted match.</p>

<p>"Partly that," he answered, drawing in the
flame, "and partly for your mother's sake.
She needs more companionship than I can give
her. She has a gay nature; she likes going out.
I hope you aren't too much like me."</p>

<p>"I hope I'm exactly like you," the girl returned
devoutly; and leaning forward, she drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
in a mouthful of the fragrant cigar smoke and
exhaled it through her nostrils. The movement
was quick and graceful, and she looked mischievously
pretty.</p>

<p>"Don't do that, you monkey," said her
father quickly.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I don't like it."</p>

<p>"I'm frightfully unfashionable, because I
smoke so little," she returned.</p>

<p>"It's a vicious habit&mdash;for women," declared
Mr. Fabian.</p>

<p>"But I'm a suffragist; besides, men tolerate
it in women now&mdash;they like them to do
it."</p>

<p>"Not the women they love," said Mr.
Fabian quickly.</p>

<p>"Oh!" responded Kathleen.</p>

<p>"When I saw you smoking a cigarette with
Edgar a little while ago," he went on, "I spoke
to you about it. Don't you remember? I told
you how unbecoming I thought it. I hoped you
would heed me."</p>

<p>Kathleen met his serious gaze.</p>

<p>"That wasn't a little while ago," she said.</p>

<p>"Certainly it was. This winter."</p>

<p>"It couldn't have been later than Novem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>ber,"
she went on slowly, "for I haven't
touched a cigarette since then."</p>

<p>"Good girl." Mr. Fabian patted her shoulder.
"It disgusted me to see you. You'll never
do it again?"</p>

<p>"No." She shook her head, and carefully
ran her finger through a ring of smoke as it
passed her.</p>

<p>"I wish I could get Edgar to say the same,"
remarked Mr. Fabian.</p>

<p>"You don't set him a good example," she
returned.</p>

<p>"You never saw me with a cigarette. Edgar
has to abstain from them in the office, but I
think he sits up all night to make up for it. I
have an idea they contribute to his general
uselessness."</p>

<p>Kathleen smoothed the care-worn lines in the
speaker's brow with her gentle fingers. He
loved their touch.</p>

<p>"I think Edgar isn't smoking much these
days," she said.</p>

<p>"Indeed." The response was indifferent.
"Why should that be? Does Mrs. Larrabee
want them all?"</p>

<p>"It's on account of his voice," said Kathleen.</p>

<p>The tired man of affairs removed his cigar to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
laugh while his daughter arranged his hair
around his temples. "Edgar denying himself!"
he ejaculated quietly.</p>

<p>"Yes, father, he's waking up to it," said the
girl, with a little serious nod; "and that's one
thing Mrs. Larrabee has really done for him&mdash;made
him believe that his voice is worth working
for."</p>

<p>"It's the only thing she can find to flatter
him about. That's all that amounts to," said
Mr. Fabian, resuming his cigar. "So long as
she can make any use of him she will keep him
dangling about, and flattery is the best bait."</p>

<p>"But his voice is a real gift," insisted Kathleen,
with deliberate emphasis. "Don't you
think so?"</p>

<p>"I never heard him sing that I know of&mdash;certainly
not for years."</p>

<p>"It is beautiful&mdash;the heart-reaching kind.
If he hadn't been a rich man's son it would
have been given to the world in some shape."</p>

<p>"A rich man's son." Mr. Fabian repeated
the words quietly, and took his daughter's arm
in a strong grasp. "Kathleen, this has been an
awful winter. I don't know what the next year
will bring forth. Say nothing to your mother,
but there are threatening clouds all about me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>"Father!" The girl pressed her cheek to his,
and there was a moment of silence; then she
spoke again gently. "I have often wished I
might have been your son."</p>

<p>The hand that had gripped her arm, stole
around her and drew her close.</p>

<p>After a moment, she sat up again and faced
him. "I came in here to-night on purpose to
speak to you about Edgar," she went on. "He
wanted me to intercede for him in a matter."</p>

<p>"A matter of debts, I suppose," said Mr.
Fabian, his manner imperturbable again, and
his tone bitter.</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm through," interrupted the man. "He
has had plenty of warning. I would not tell
you, Kathleen, the number of foolish, and
sometimes disgraceful, affairs I have settled
for him."</p>

<p>"I don't doubt it, dear, but let me tell you
about this," said the girl seriously. "Edgar
has no judgment or foresight. He persists in
claiming that he was born with a golden spoon
in his mouth and that whatever he can scoop
up with it is his right. He is your only son and
you owe him unlimited liberty."</p>

<p>"The lessons I have given him would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
sufficient if he had any brains," said the father
sternly.</p>

<p>"Yes; but just a minute more. This debt
will astonish you. It is to Mazzini, the famous
voice teacher. He has been studying with him
since January."</p>

<p>"Just like his vanity! Let him send the bill
to Mrs. Larrabee. It is her doing."</p>

<p>"Yes, it was her doing in the first place, but
I suspect from what Edgar says that she is
tired of him. He hasn't seen her often of late,
and she sails for Europe anyway next week;
and Edgar is so interested in his music that now
it comes first. His teacher is so enthusiastic!"</p>

<p>"Of course he is!" observed Mr. Fabian
cynically. "They're always enthusiastic over
the voices of pupils whose pocketbooks will
stand the strain."</p>

<p>"Edgar sang for me last night while you and
mother were out. Father, it was a beautiful
performance. It is the real thing. Of course,
he was wrong&mdash;crazy, to go into such expense
without asking you, for the lessons are frightfully
dear; but if the boy were to amount to
something in an artistic line, wouldn't it be
worth the investment? You are discouraged
by his lack of interest in business."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Fabian's chin sank dejectedly as he
flicked the ash from his cigar into the receiver
on the stand beside his chair.</p>

<p>"Discouraged by his inability," he said
slowly; "discouraged by his lack of principle,
by his vanity and conceit. I will give him board
and lodging as long as he wishes to live with
me; but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then, dear," interrupted Kathleen, her
voice thrilling with the sympathy she felt, "try
this one thing more. If the expense doesn't
appall you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Fabian shook his head impatiently.
"That would be nothing&mdash;as yet."</p>

<p>"Edgar can't study through the summer.
His teacher is going to Italy. He would like to
go with him&mdash;" the girl paused doubtfully.</p>

<p>Her father laughed. "I dare say. Edgar's
European travel, however, is over until he is
engaged to sing before the crowned heads."</p>

<p>"Yes, I supposed so," agreed the girl; "but
he means to work faithfully all summer."</p>

<p>"Work faithfully! Edgar!" repeated Mr.
Fabian.</p>

<p>"Supposing he should, father. Supposing he
has found his niche in life and will do something
worth while."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wonderful if true," remarked Mr. Fabian.</p>

<p>"But it won't help to disbelieve in him. I
know he began all wrong forcing you to pay
this money&mdash;"</p>

<p>Kathleen arose suddenly, and, moving across
the room, opened the heavy door of the den.
"Come in, Edgar," she called. The invitation
was unnecessary; for the youth, in his eagerness
to hear what fate was being meted out to him
within the closed apartment, had been leaning
so hard against the door that when all at once
it fell away from him, he staggered into the
room with the most undignified celerity.</p>

<p>Stirred as Kathleen was, she had to bite
her lip before she could speak; but when
her brother had gained his perpendicular
and faced them with a somewhat frightened
and very crimson countenance, she broke the
silence.</p>

<p>"Tell father," she said, "that you know you
began this new venture wrong: that it was
shameful to force him to pay this big bill for
your lessons."</p>

<p>Edgar choked and swallowed, meeting the
eyes that were lifting to him from the depths
of the leathern armchair. Convicted of eavesdropping
and reading the cold appraisement in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
his father's gaze, he had not gathered himself
to utter a word when Mr. Fabian spoke.</p>

<p>"You have not forced me," he said slowly.
"I can refuse. You are of age. You can be
sued and imprisoned quite independently of
me."</p>

<p>Edgar's heart beat fast and he set the even
teeth.</p>

<p>"You have counted once more on my unwillingness
to have this occur; but that unwillingness
has been weakening for years."</p>

<p>Still Edgar did not speak. Kathleen, standing
by her father's chair, her hands clasped
tightly, dared not. She noted that Edgar's gaze
did not fall. He met his father's eyes in crimson
silence.</p>

<p>"You know," continued Mr. Fabian distinctly,
"whether I have exhausted persuasion
and argument with you. You know my futile
attempts to rouse your ambition to be my
coadjutor, my successor. What you do not
know, because you are incapable of understanding,
is the agony of the slow death of my
hope in my only son: the successive stages of
thought which have finally reduced me to
closing the account, and charging him up to
profit and loss."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>Kathleen watched her brother under the
lash with the same pitiful misery she felt for his
punishments when they were children.</p>

<p>"But you're going to try him in this new
field, father," she said beseechingly.</p>

<p>There was a space of silence, then Mr. Fabian
spoke:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am going to trust your sister's judgment
in this matter, Edgar. She believes you are in
earnest. I am going to pay these tuition bills,
and the coming months will show whether this
is another passing toy, or a matter in which you
can make good. To find you are good for anything,
my boy," added the father, after another
painful pause, "will be an amazing and welcome
discovery."</p>

<p>Something clicked in Edgar's throat. He
evidently wished to speak, but his tongue
seemed glued to the roof of his mouth. At last
he found voice.</p>

<p>"I don't blame you," he said jerkily, "but&mdash;I'll
show you!"</p>

<p>Mr. Fabian nodded his head slightly. "That's
what I want," he said quietly; "I need to be
shown."</p>

<p>Without another word, Edgar turned on his
heel and left the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>Kathleen sank on her knees and buried her
face on her father's breast.</p>

<p>"He didn't thank you," she said, half
weeping, "but he felt it. I know he felt it. Oh,
father, how I hope for your sake&mdash;"</p>

<p>She could not speak further, and Mr. Fabian
patted her shoulder, his eyes gazing out the
darkening window.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">MRS. FABIAN'S SCHEME</p>


<p>Mrs. Fabian chanced to meet Edgar as he was
leaving the house immediately after this interview.
She had heard the closing of the library
door, and the expression of her son's excited
face, as he strode by her, was such that she let
him go in silence.</p>

<p>She knew Kathleen was with her father, and
she was only too willing to use the girl as a buffer
when Edgar was the subject of conversation.</p>

<p>She moved about restlessly until she heard
Kathleen leave the den and close the door softly
behind her. Then she waylaid her daughter at
the foot of the staircase. By the soft light of
the electric lantern, she could see that the girl's
eyes were red.</p>

<p>"Come right up to my room," she whispered,
excitedly, as if the very walls had ears. "I just
met Edgar."</p>

<p>They ascended in silence and Mrs. Fabian led
the way into her boudoir, started an electric
fan, and turned on the light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>"Has his father cut him off?" she asked, facing
Kathleen, her gaze wide with dread.</p>

<p>"No, oh, no." The girl sank into a chair.
"It was awful, but I hope it is the beginning of
better things. Did you know that Edgar had
begun to work with his voice?"</p>

<p>"No! I've noticed that he has been making
the most awful noises in his room lately."</p>

<p>"Well, the talk grew out of that and the new
debts he has contracted."</p>

<p>"Edgar can't turn around without getting
into debt!" ejaculated his mother desperately.</p>

<p>Kathleen told her then what had occurred
and she listened attentively.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose it will amount to anything?"
she asked at last.</p>

<p>Kathleen shook her head vaguely. "I don't
know enough about the opportunities," she
replied, "and I know too much about Edgar.
If he is only going to use an accomplishment to
stand in a more brilliant limelight with those
whose admiration he wants&mdash;" she shook her
head again.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian looked thoughtful. "I never
saw such a look in his face as he had just
now."</p>

<p>"Father's words stung him, I know. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
even said, 'I don't blame you.' Perhaps he will
begin now to be a man."</p>

<p>"I thought he might be going forever. I
didn't dare to speak to him."</p>

<p>Kathleen gave a disclaiming exclamation.
"He couldn't do that. He is more helpless
than a little new-fledged chicken."</p>

<p>"I don't know," returned Mrs. Fabian sapiently.
"Take a weak, good-looking fellow like
Edgar, with a lovely voice, and if he became
reckless there are plenty of sporty cafs in this
town where they would pay him as an attraction.
He knows that."</p>

<p>"Mother!" exclaimed Kathleen, aghast.</p>

<p>"Why, certainly!" averred Mrs. Fabian dismally
elated at the dismay she had evoked.
"There are a few things I know more about
than you do, Kathleen. Imagine a handsome
young fellow in correct evening clothes, when
the patrons are hilarious at midnight, rising in
his place, and, wineglass in hand, suddenly
singing a love-song or ragtime. Do you think
he would get a few encores? Do you think he
could get paid to come again?" Mrs. Fabian
had heard a description of lurid New Year's
Eve revels and she built a shrewd surmise
upon it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>Kathleen was so worked upon by the picture
that she rose restlessly, and moving to the window
gazed into the summer gloom as if searching
for a glimpse of her brother's well-carried,
polished blond head.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian bridled with dignified importance
as she watched her; but her complacency
was short-lived.</p>

<p>Kathleen suddenly faced about. "Then
how," she asked, "can you wish me to leave for
the island at such a time?"</p>

<p>"Oh, are you going back to that again!"</p>

<p>"With father and Edgar in this sensitive state
toward each other&mdash;to leave them to meet
alone in this great house, with no one to soften
the embarrassment. Would it be any wonder if
Edgar fled to just such scenes as you describe?
And wouldn't it be decidedly our fault?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian leaned forward in her armchair.</p>

<p>"You couldn't do any permanent good,"
she said earnestly. "Edgar must really act
alone, whether you are here or not. He hasn't
done any of his practising here anyway, except
those uncanny noises in his room."</p>

<p>"No. There is some piano house where he
has been able to use a room at noon; but his
teacher sails this week and he cannot get the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
room any more. He would naturally do a lot of
work at home after you were gone, if he felt
at ease; and if I were here, it would help a great
deal."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian felt baffled. The truth of Kathleen's
proposition was unanswerable; and to
urge any claim above Edgar's good at this
crucial time would be, she knew, inexcusable
in his sister's eyes.</p>

<p>The girl, burdened with the double responsibility
of her father's confidence, and Edgar's
future, turned again to the window and gazed
out into the darkness, while Mrs. Fabian, leaning
back in the breeze from the electric fan,
put on her thinking-cap. It seemed hard that
her wayward boy, if he had started on a worthy
road, should manage at his very first step to
get in her way.</p>

<p>Her will was strong and shrewd. When later
that night she was alone with her husband, she
opened the subject.</p>

<p>"Kathleen tells me Edgar has taken up serious
work with his voice."</p>

<p>"Kathleen is optimistic," was the laconic
reply.</p>

<p>"I think, Henry, we ought to meet him half-way
in any honourable undertaking."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Fabian made an inarticulate exclamation.
He was thinking of the bill Kathleen had
placed in his hands before she left him to-night.</p>

<p>"I can't think," proceeded Mrs. Fabian,
"that anything but a high sense of duty would
induce anybody to make the blood-curdling
noises that I've heard lately from Edgar's
room."</p>

<p>A short silence; then Mrs. Fabian spoke
again. "It seems he cannot go any longer to
the place where he has done his practising. I'm
afraid if he should work evenings here, it might
annoy you, Henry."</p>

<p>"I dare say it might," agreed the weary man,
with an involuntary sigh.</p>

<p>"I was thinking that if he is not very busy
at the office&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Very busy!" The father threw back his
head.</p>

<p>"You might give him a longer vacation"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Edgar's whole life is a vacation," said Mr.
Fabian.</p>

<p>"And let him go with us to the island. If he
is really going to make music his lifework he
could practise regularly there and be away
from temptations, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Fabian slowly faced his wife with such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
attention that she paused hopefully, then went
on:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You know Philip Sidney is going with me, and
his companionship would be so good for Edgar."</p>

<p>"It's a bright thought, my dear," said Mr.
Fabian. "The office will be able to struggle
along without Edgar, and then we can close the
house and I can live at the club."</p>

<p>"Not too long," said his wife, so pleased at
her sudden success that she put her arms around
his neck and kissed him. "Not too long, Henry.
You must take a long vacation this year."</p>

<p>He returned her caress. "One day at a time,"
he said briefly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian sought her pillow, well-pleased;
and contrary to her habit, she was up betimes
next morning, and hastened to her son's room
before he came down to breakfast.</p>

<p>"Can I come in?" she asked, knocking.</p>

<p>Edgar was in his shirt-sleeves adjusting his
tie; and when he opened the door and saw his
mother, he gave an exclamation.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he asked. "Too hot
to sleep?"</p>

<p>A cloudless sun was promising another day
with a soaring thermometer.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian noted the hard questioning in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
her boy's eyes. She knew he considered her his
father's aid in denying him the right to spend
as a millionaire's son should&mdash;knew that his
attitude toward her had long been defensive;
and that her unusual visit to his room roused
only his suspicion of something disagreeable.</p>

<p>"Do you mind if I come in, dear?" she asked,
her soft silks trailing noiselessly as she moved
across the room. "I am so interested in what
I hear about your music."</p>

<p>Edgar was silent, continuing to busy himself
with his tie. He knew his stepmother too well
to believe that she had risen with the lark to
felicitate him on his last venture. He took up
the ivory military brushes she had given him
and began to use them vigorously. He was still
smarting from the scene of the night before
and he braced himself for a homily on the subject
of his music bill.</p>

<p>"I've never believed in thwarting a child's
bent," said Mrs. Fabian, flicking the ashes from
a chair to make it fit to sit upon. "I said to
Philip Sidney's mother, 'let him paint.' I said
to your father last night when I heard all this,
'let Edgar sing.'"</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian paused to allow her breadth of
view to sink in. Edgar glanced around at her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
sulkily, from his mirror, and then looked back
again.</p>

<p>"Now, you have no taste for commercial life,
dear, why waste more time in it at present until
you see what the artistic line holds for you?"</p>

<p>Edgar glanced back at the speaker again
quickly. What was the "nigger in the fence"?
Her face looked innocently out at him from a
becoming boudoir cap.</p>

<p>"And I suggested to your father that he let
your vacation start earlier and that you come
with us to the island next Wednesday. You are
going to work for a time anyway without your
teacher, and this hot atmosphere must be so
relaxing to the throat. There it is pure and
bracing and you can lay out your course of
study and be undisturbed."</p>

<p>Edgar regarded the speaker with some interest
now, but still questioning.</p>

<p>"Father thinks, then, we could close the
house and he would live at the club."</p>

<p>Edgar tossed his head, raised his eyebrows,
and proceeded to put on his coat.</p>

<p>"You want to close the house. That's it,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Don't you think it would be a good plan?"
asked Mrs. Fabian ingratiatingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>All Edgar's cynicism was not proof against
allowing some satisfaction to appear in the
prospect of leaving the office routine and pursuing
the line of work which had genuinely
captured his interest.</p>

<p>"Yes, I don't mind," he answered. "Kath
going with you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and Philip Sidney,&mdash;just for a short
visit."</p>

<p>Edgar shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"You can imagine the heat of that stable
room," suggested Mrs. Fabian.</p>

<p>"Tophet, I suppose," agreed Edgar. "All
right. I'll go." The even teeth had been set
many times since last evening in the prospect
of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tte--tte</i> existence with his father.</p>

<p>"I wish we might go on all together, but, of
course, not knowing, I didn't engage a berth
for you."</p>

<p>"I'll go on the day train," responded
Edgar; adding with his customary grace, "I
never was keen for travelling in caravans anyway."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian was not critical of his rudeness.
She was too pleased at having gained her end,
and soon floated away to Kathleen's room, her
next strategic point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>She found her daughter propped up in bed
with coffee and toast on a table before her.</p>

<p>"Good morning, mother, you put me to
shame," said the girl. "Didn't you sleep
either? This is early for you."</p>

<p>"Poor child," said Mrs. Fabian, seating herself
on the foot of the bed and observing the
rings around the other's eyes. "Yes, I slept
pretty well, but not until after your father and
I had had a long talk."</p>

<p>Kathleen scrutinized her mother's complacent
countenance and made up her mind that
the talk could not have concerned business.</p>

<p>"I told him how sure I felt that Edgar was in
earnest now, and we both concluded it was time
wasted to try any longer to fit a square peg
into a round hole, so your father is going to let
the boy go to the island at once with us and
work at his voice there, away from temptations."</p>

<p>"Oh, how fine!" breathed Kathleen. "Then,"
she added aloud, "he will entertain Mr. Sidney
in my place, and I can stay with father."</p>

<p>"That's an absurd idea and you know it.
Philip and Edgar would get along like two
tigers. You can see that I need you more than
ever to reconcile them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>Kathleen's face did not look encouraging.
She longed to tell her mother of her father's
straits, but her lips were sealed.</p>

<p>"Besides," added Mrs. Fabian, with the
conscious power of one who plays the last
trump, "one reason your father wishes to dispense
with Edgar is that he wants to close the
house and live at the club."</p>

<p>Kathleen's face fell and her eyes looked away.</p>

<p>"You see he'll come to us all the sooner,
dear," said her mother. "Men talk about enjoying
living at the club, but when they are
happy family men they tire of it very soon."</p>

<p>The girl smiled faintly. "We have been
something of a 'happy family' lately," she said;
"but if Edgar really turns over a new leaf&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, he has!" declared Mrs. Fabian. "I'm
glad to remember that the outdoors is large at
Brewster's. I suspect he will nearly drive us
crazy, but one must exercise some self-sacrifice
in this world." She rose. "Take another nap if
you can, Kathleen. I'm thankful the island is
so near for you. You're completely tired out."</p>

<p>But Kathleen did not take another nap. She
dressed very soon, and, pleading a desire for
fresh air, left the house. She did not ask for the
machine lest her mother should offer to accom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>pany
her, but descended in all her dainty whiteness
into the subway and started for Wall
Street. Arrived at the labyrinth of offices
where daily Mr. Fabian struggled and Edgar
endured, she dreaded meeting her brother, but
she saw nothing of him, and waited in an ante-room,
looking about her with a swelling heart.
How little part she and her mother had ever
had in the heavy responsibilities of her father's
life. She doubted if her mother came here twice
a year, and when she did it was simply to obtain
money.</p>

<p>She had not long to wait, for Mr. Fabian
himself opened the door of his private office,
and the clerk passing out saw him stoop and
kiss the girl in the large hat strewn with lilacs.</p>

<p>"What brings you, my dear?" he asked, his
brows knitting anxiously. She smiled and
clung to his hand as they moved inside.
"You're pale, Kathleen. Off to the island with
you, child. Off to the island."</p>

<p>"That's just what I came about," she answered,
taking the chair he set for her, and the
electric fan whirring above her head carried the
scent of orris to her father. "I would so much
rather stay with you. I came to urge you to let
me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>He regarded her with eyes full of affection
and gave a short laugh.</p>

<p>"I frightened you last night," he said. "Perhaps
I did wrong."</p>

<p>"No, no, you didn't. Mother told me the
plan to let Edgar go. That is right. Edgar
can't be a comfort to you; but I can, father.
Don't shut up the house. Let me stay with you
till you are ready to go."</p>

<p>Mr. Fabian nodded, his eyes fixed upon the
sensitive face with its beseeching eyes.</p>

<p>"You're a good girl, Kathleen. You are a
comfort to me, whether we're together or not;
and just now it will be an advantage to me to
live close to my associates at the club. Go without
anxiety, child. I promise to keep you advised
of everything important."</p>

<p>The troubled eyes did not leave his face.</p>

<p>"Don't exaggerate what I said last night. I
am not going to make any spectacular failure,
but I have my own ideas of equity and I'm not
going to wriggle out on a technicality. My
course may lose me friends as well as money;
but I've got to live with myself, and there are
some memories I don't propose to entertain.
Your mother has always been moderate in her
demands, she has never shared the insane ambi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>tions
of some of her acquaintances; but her
toys are very dear to her and I hate to curtail
them. It looks as if I might have to."</p>

<p>"It might be the making of Edgar," said
Kathleen.</p>

<p>Her father regarded her in silent admiration.
It was evident that her own part in the loss had
not occurred to her.</p>

<p>"Your mother's unselfishness in keeping the
island summer home, because I like its simplicity,
makes this season's problem easy. By
autumn I shall know the worst."</p>

<p>"How I would like to stay with you right
along until everything is settled," said Kathleen
fervently. "I want to be sure that you
know how happy I should be in it. I keep so
busy with my slides and microscope, and then&mdash;there's
something else I do." Kathleen
colored consciously. "I meant not to tell any
one yet, but,&mdash;I write a little!"</p>

<p>"Stories, you mean?"</p>

<p>The girl nodded. "It is nothing, it may never
amount to anything; but the microscope suggested
it to me. There is such a great world
that we never enter or think about. So you can
see how happy I should be in our big, cool house,
and not a bit lonely,&mdash;if you'll only have me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>"I believe you, Kathleen, but it wouldn't
work, dear. I could be at home so little, and
I'd like to cut off the expense of the house."</p>

<p>"Oh, oh! Is it so bad as that?"</p>

<p>"No, not nearly so bad; but in time of peace,
prepare for war."</p>

<p>"Then mother had better not take her usual
weeks at a resort."</p>

<p>Mr. Fabian raised his eyebrows. "How else
is the dear lady to exhibit her summer toilets?
The fish at the island are so unappreciative."</p>

<p>"Don't keep things from mother," pleaded
Kathleen.</p>

<p>"I promise not to when there is anything to
tell. I was weak enough to think out loud with
you. Now, run along, my child."</p>

<p>"Oh, father, always be weak enough to think
out loud with me. Will you?" He had risen
and she did so reluctantly.</p>

<p>He crushed her trim whiteness in his arms,
and kissed her. "Don't make me sorry, then.
Don't cross any bridge until you come to it.
Promise."</p>

<p>She smiled up at him bravely. "I promise,"
she said, and left the office with a wistful backward
look at him standing there, his eyes following
her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="ph3">CASCO BAY</p>


<p>Pat's benevolent heart swelled with satisfaction
when, a few evenings later, Philip ran down
the stable stairs, his packed suitcase in hand.</p>

<p>"Wish you were going along," said the artist,
meeting the Irishman's approving gaze.</p>

<p>"I will as soon as ye need a valet," was the
reply. "Ye think I can't put on style!" Pat
winked and shook his head knowingly. "Ye'd
burst wid pride if ye saw me fixed up and waitin'
on ye."</p>

<p>"I haven't a doubt of it. Well, so long. It
will be only a few nights before I shall be back,
sizzling with you again." And Phil gave the
man a smiling nod and went out of the door,
almost running into the arms of Mrs. Fabian,
who, in the trimmest of cool grey travelling
gowns, was looking askance at a spring and
mattress outside the barn door.</p>

<p>Pat aghast, hastened to button the open throat
of his shirt. "The Queen o' Sheby," he muttered.</p>

<p>"Why, did I keep you waiting, Aunt Isabel?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
asked Phil, with contrition. "I was planning to
be out in front in plenty of time."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is early, but I wanted to speak to
your man a minute."</p>

<p>Pat bowed in the direction of the voluminous
grey chiffon veil. "You may go out and join
Kathleen," Mrs. Fabian added.</p>

<p>"Dear me, nothing private, I hope," said
Phil, vastly amused by the conflicting emotions
on the Irishman's face.</p>

<p>"Have you seen to putting your evening
clothes away?" asked Mrs. Fabian.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why, they're hanging up there in
the closet."</p>

<p>"Just what I expected. Run along, and I'll
tell this good man what to do."</p>

<p>Phil gave Pat one humorous glance and
obeyed, passing out toward the street where he
soon saw Kathleen in the waiting car, her hat
tied down by a roseate veil.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian at once accosted Pat. "Could
you pack up Mr. Sidney's belongings and send
them after him, if we ask you?"</p>

<p>"I could, mum, but 'tis only a week he'll
be away."</p>

<p>"He wouldn't want his evening clothes. Do
you know what a moth-bag is?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do not, thin."</p>

<p>"Well, go to the store and ask, please. Brush
Mr. Sidney's evening clothes thoroughly and
put them in the bag, seal it up tight, and hang
it in the closet. The careless boy. That's what
comes of always having had a mother."</p>

<p>"Lot's o' folks is jist that careless," remarked
Pat. He was beginning to feel that even a
queen, if she invaded his own vine and fig tree,
might be a little less peremptory.</p>

<p>"You may send everything else, except of
course his winter overcoat. By the way, you
may get another moth-bag for that, and treat
it in the same manner."</p>

<p>"He'll not be stayin', mum. He's all for
work."</p>

<p>"Has he been sleeping out here on these hot
stones?" demanded Mrs. Fabian, with dilating
nostrils, looking at the mattress.</p>

<p>"No, mum, he usually took the bed," responded
the Irishman.</p>

<p>"Well, you've carried his upstairs, I see."</p>

<p>"I'll have to break it to ye that he did it
himself," said the man.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian ignored his manner. Her thought
was filled with Philip's situation.</p>

<p>"Well, here," she said, with a preoccupied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
air, and, taking a bill from the fine-mesh purse
which hung from her wrist, she held it out to
the Irishman. "Take this and do what I've
asked you. You needn't prepay the trunk if
you send it. Keep the change, and I hope the
heat here won't grow any worse. Good-bye."
And Mrs. Fabian turned on her heel and the
grey chiffon floated away up the alley.</p>

<p>Pat looked at the five-dollar bill he held and
tossed his head. "Who is that bye," he muttered,
"and will he iver live in the stable ag'in?"</p>

<p>Suddenly, bethinking himself that he might
see the grand departure of his lodger, he hurried
out to the street, and was in time to see Phil's
straw hat loom amid a confusion of grey and
rosy streaming veils.</p>

<p>"Sure, 'tis only the rich enjoys this life," he
thought good-naturedly, and unbuttoning his
neckband again, he returned to his palm-leaf fan.</p>

<p>As the motor flew breezily through the hot
city streets, Philip gave himself up to the
pleasure of his outing. Mrs. Fabian regarded
him with supreme satisfaction, and Kathleen,
though a little heartsore from parting with her
father, dared not indulge in a pensive moment,
knowing that her mother would pounce upon it
alertly and later reproach her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>They passed the evening in the stateroom of
the flying train, and Mrs. Fabian narrated with
much dignity the tale of Edgar's retirement
from commercial life in favor of the arts. Philip
pricked up his ears when he learned that the
heir of the house was expected at the island at
once.</p>

<p>Kathleen was not obliged to talk much, and
at last they all ceased fanning themselves and
shouting remarks against the clatter of the open
windows, and retired.</p>

<p>After breakfast the following morning, as
they entered a carriage to cross Portland,
Kathleen nodded at Philip.</p>

<p>"Say good-bye to heat," she remarked.</p>

<p>"Hard to believe," returned the Westerner,
who had tried to refrain from talking of his
native mountains. His thoughts often travelled
back even to the stable studio where certain
work begun stood awaiting his return; but soon
after they entered the boat for the island, he
began to see Kathleen's words fulfilled. The
ladies wrapped themselves in heavy coats and
Mrs. Fabian begged Phil to put on his sweater;
but he held his hat in his hand and declared his
desire to be chilled to the bone.</p>

<p>As they pulled out past the near islands into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
wide spaces of sea, interest slowly grew in Phil's
eyes. His comments grew less frequent, and
finally stopped. The islands rose tree-crowned
from the water, casting deep green reflections
at their feet. Phil took a notebook from his
pocket, and occasionally asking the name of an
island, he wrote it in the book. Kathleen,
understanding his intent, and knowing that he
would not fulfil it because of greater satisfaction
further on, smiled at her mother.</p>

<p>"What did I tell you?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Well, what did you?"</p>

<p>"That he wouldn't know whether I was here
or not."</p>

<p>"Sh&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"He can't hear me any more than if he were
ansthetized."</p>

<p>"Hush, Kathleen."</p>

<p>"I'll prove it." She raised her voice. "Mr.
Sidney!"</p>

<p>Phil not only did not reply, but after a moment
more he moved away to another and more
unobstructed spot.</p>

<p>Kathleen gave a low laugh and Mrs. Fabian
looked pleased.</p>

<p>"He is enjoying it, isn't he?" she returned.
"This day is a wonderful bit of good fortune.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
First impressions are so important. What made
you expect him to behave like this?"</p>

<p>"I think I must have a groping, artistic sense
myself. At any rate, I knew what Casco Bay
must do to an artist when he comes upon it all
unprepared."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian sighed. "Well, I'm glad our
coming here does somebody some good. Are
you going on forever calling that boy 'Mr.'?
Of course, he can't be informal with you unless
you will be so with him."</p>

<p>"Mother dear, I tell you it doesn't matter,"
laughed the girl. "He has gone into a trance
and he probably won't come out of it till the
first fog. By that time, perhaps I shall feel
entirely informal."</p>

<p>Captain James stood on the pier when the
boat approached Brewster's Island. Kathleen
caught sight of him and waved her handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Mother, it's time to go and make passes
over Philip," she said. "He'll have to wake
up."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian went to the guest and touched
him on the arm. For an hour and a half he had
not addressed them.</p>

<p>He started.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>"We're there, Phil," she said.</p>

<p>He followed her, and glanced at Kathleen
with a sensation of guilt. He seized the bags
with an alacrity intended to offset his preoccupation.</p>

<p>"It's a wonderful bay," he said.</p>

<p>Kathleen was not regarding him. She was
leaning over the rail, waving again toward a
tall lean man on the wharf, who smiled,
well-pleased, and jerked his head in her direction.</p>

<p>Soon many passengers were streaming up the
gangplank, and in a minute Kathleen was greeting
the tall lean man with a gayety Phil had
never before seen in her demeanor.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian next shook hands with him, and
introduced Phil, who, in the confusion and
limitations of the commonplace wharf, had
quite regained his normal alertness.</p>

<p>"You gave us a very nice day, Cap'n James,"
said Mrs. Fabian graciously. "Where's the
carriage?"</p>

<p>"Waitin'. Can't take you all, I'm afraid.
Mrs. Frick from down-along engaged me
ahead."</p>

<p>"Ahead of us?" inquired Mrs. Fabian
superbly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>"Got one seat," said Captain James. He
was accustomed to Mrs. Fabian's autocracy.</p>

<p>"That's all we want," said Kathleen. "Mr.
Sidney and I will walk up."</p>

<p>So Mrs. Fabian and the bags were stowed in
the carriage and the young people were started
on their walk before Tom had turned heavily
into the road.</p>

<p>"What air!" exclaimed Phil, as they struck
into the deep grass.</p>

<p>"One can live on it," agreed the girl.</p>

<p>"Don't expect me to; I feel wonderful pangs
already. Gramercy Park had nearly cured me
of eating."</p>

<p>He smiled down at his companion in the roseate
veil tied under her chin, and she glanced
up at the city pallor of his face. "I should
think it might," she agreed. "Wait a week.
We shall both look like tomatoes and feel like
disembodied spirits."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I behaved like the latter, coming
down the bay; but really I forgot everything.
I want to study the boat-tables and go back
to some of those wonderful shores."</p>

<p>Kathleen smiled demurely. "This doesn't
cut much of a figure by contrast, does it?" she
said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>They were crossing diagonally through a
green field which led gently up to the island
road.</p>

<p>"It's beautifully fresh here," replied Phil
politely, looking about the bare treeless expanse
rolling up to a bluff against illimitable
sky.</p>

<p>A village store upon the road, a little school-house
and a cottage or two, were all that was
to be seen.</p>

<p>Above, on Mrs. Wright's doorstep, Eliza
Brewster was standing, opera glass in hand,
watching the tall figure and the rosy veil coming
up through the field. She had restrained
herself from running down to the road, for she
dreaded Mrs. Fabian, and Phil for the moment
had forgotten that Eliza might be in the neighborhood.
His eyes brightened as they reached
the road. He had been privately wondering
why the Fabians had chosen this unpromising
island as their abiding place. Now he caught
sight of the spreading cove, its brilliant banks
dark with evergreen trees, while in sheltered
spots maples and birches stood amid a riot of
shrubs inviting the birds.</p>

<p>"That's a fine cove," he said, his eyes fixed
on the far reaches of the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>"So the yachtsmen think," returned Kathleen.</p>

<p>"Let's look at it a minute," said Phil.</p>

<p>The girl paused obediently and a smile
touched the corners of her lips. Phil's impersonality
with regard to herself was novel; for Kathleen
had the intangible quality called charm to
such a degree that nothing masculine had ever
before been able to approach so near to her
without striving to win her favor.</p>

<p>From that first Sunday in the stable studio
she had perceived that if she were going to see
more of this new factor in the family circle she
must do the striving if she were to become a
factor to him. A dread that she might desire
to do this had beset her ever since, and warned
her away from him with a sense of self-preservation.</p>

<p>He stood forgetful of her now, and narrowed
his eyes to the picture.</p>

<p>"Well, have you looked enough?" she asked.
"How are the pangs?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," he replied hurriedly. "I can
come back."</p>

<p>"Certainly, we promise not to lock you up,"
she answered, half-laughing. "We'll get better
views of it, too, as we go on," she added, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
turned at a right angle into a green ribbon road
leading up a second incline.</p>

<p>Phil looked about vaguely, and followed her.
He noticed on the crest above them a cottage
of boulders and shingles.</p>

<p>"Yours?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Home, sweet home," she answered.</p>

<p>Captain James passed them now with his
load, and by the time they reached the cottage,
Mrs. Fabian was on the steps to welcome them;
but Philip was absorbed in the surprise which
the summit of that hill gave the newcomer.
Before him, but a few rods away, spread the
Atlantic, foaming at the foot of the bluff. Distant
islands came near in the crystal air, their
outline defined by rocks, which in the distance
seemed ribbons of sandy beach. The superb
breadth of view, ending either in the horizon
or in the irregular skyline of the mainland, took
the breath of the unfamiliar.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian straightened with pleasure in
the spellbound look of her guest as, his hat
dropped upon the grass, he gazed in silence.
It was her island and her view. She started to
speak, but Kathleen touched her finger to her
lips with a suggestive smile; so the lady sank
instead into a hammock chair. Her maid Molly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
came out of the house, greeted the ladies and
carried in their bags, saying that dinner would
be served whenever they were ready.</p>

<p>Philip, from his stand below on the grass,
turned and looked up at them, his eyes dark
with the blue of the sea.</p>

<p>"I understand now," he said, "why you
haven't talked about it."</p>

<p>"Come in and have something to eat," suggested
his exultant hostess. "We have noon
dinner. Kathleen simply refuses to shorten the
day with a long evening meal."</p>

<p>Philip gave the girl a brilliant smile of appreciation.</p>

<p>"After dinner," went on Mrs. Fabian,
"Kathleen will take you to walk to some of our
pretty places."</p>

<p>"No, indeed," said the girl hastily. "I understand
just how Mr. Sidney will love to
explore for himself. I wouldn't spoil his surprises."</p>

<p>Philip said nothing to the contrary. His
thoughts were absorbed taking mental stock
of the materials he had brought, and he followed
mechanically into the charming cottage
whose every window framed a water scene,
waves creaming upon the rocks which stretched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
granite fingers unceasingly to grasp them, while
unceasingly they slipped away.</p>

<p>As soon as Phil reached his room he threw
open his suitcase with feverish haste and examined
all the sketching paraphernalia he had
packed so hastily.</p>

<p>The music box which called to meals played
all its tunes, but the guest did not appear. At
last Mrs. Fabian sent Molly to knock on his
door.</p>

<p>"What a wonderful day," she said to Kathleen
when they were alone, "and in June one is
so likely to strike fog and rain. Now let it come.
He has seen what Brewster's Island really is&mdash;or
he will see when you have taken him about
this afternoon. The only drawback to the whole
trip so far has been your refusal to do that.
How could you be so abrupt, my dear?"</p>

<p>"Mother, don't try to manage an artist,"
replied the girl emphatically. "He will want
only to be let alone. Can't you see it? And so
do I." Kathleen looked remarkably defiant.
"I want to be let alone. This is my vacation,
too, remember. I have worked as hard as he
has."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian met her child's determined regard
with surprise. Kathleen did look pale and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
thin, now that she had time to observe it.
The heat of the train last night had not been
conducive to sleep.</p>

<p>"Very well, dear," she acquiesced with
meekness. "Perhaps you ought to lie down this
afternoon. I'm sure I shall. I'd like the very
waves to be still."</p>

<p>As she spoke the last word, Philip appeared
and they sat down at table. The combination
of the air and the delicious fresh sea-food to
one long unaccustomed to home fare made the
guest suspend all artistic calculations and do
such justice to the dinner that Mrs. Fabian
sighed.</p>

<p>"It is such a satisfaction to have a man's
appetite at the table," she said, when Phil
made laughing apology and referred to the city
restaurants. "To-morrow we shall have two
men."</p>

<p>"To be sure," thought Phil. These were
Edgar's mother and sister and home. Somehow
he could not fit the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">blas</i> society man into this
Arcadia. He must make the most of to-day.</p>

<p>As his hunger wore away he looked more and
more from the windows. The dining-room
might have been on a ship for the freedom of
its vast sea views. When they rose from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
table, he looked at Kathleen with boyish
expectancy.</p>

<p>"Are we going to walk?" he asked.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian interposed with the best intentions.
"I don't think Kathleen had better go,
after all, Phil," she said. "She is very tired.
She is going to lie down. You won't mind running
about this first afternoon by yourself,
I'm sure."</p>

<p>Kathleen saw disappointment and then concern
grow in the guest's face, for he suddenly
observed that she was pale.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, I wouldn't think of wasting time
lying down," she said cheerfully. "Wait a few
minutes. I'll be downstairs in a jiffy."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian watched her as she ran lightly
up the stairway.</p>

<p>"Do you think she ought to go?" asked Phil
doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Philip," returned his hostess dryly, "don't
ask me what I think. If you ever have a
daughter twenty years old and just out of
college, you will find the safest, wisest course is
not to think at all." But she smiled as she said
it; for this time Kathleen's waywardness was
not displeasing.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">FLASHES OF BLUE</p>


<p>When Kathleen ran downstairs a little later,
Phil looked at her in smiling surprise. The elegant
Miss Fabian had disappeared. In her
stead was a young girl, shorter by the height
of a fashionable boot-heel, and with braided
hair wound around her head, fastened by a
broad bow of black ribbon. Her short, dark-blue
skirt reached to her ankles and a Tam o'
Shanter crowned her head.</p>

<p>Phil turned to his hostess. "What a strong
family resemblance your youngest bears to
Miss Fabian. I should know she was her sister
if I met her anywhere."</p>

<p>"Yes, this is Kathleen, not Miss Fabian.
Don't forget it. When you come back, I expect
you to be treating each other as cousins should.
Don't let her walk too far, Phil." Mrs. Fabian
stifled a yawn. "I think I shall take a nap in
the wind-break."</p>

<p>She watched the pair as they moved away from
the house. The breeze was tossing the short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
dark hair on Phil's uncovered head. Kathleen,
in her rubber-soled, heelless shoes, scarcely
reached his ear.</p>

<p>"I'm glad now," mused Mrs. Fabian, "that
Kathleen is a Van Ruysler iceberg. If she were
a susceptible girl, I wouldn't wish her to be
with that man a minute. What matter if he is
a high-minded, fine chap? If he didn't care
for her she'd suffer just the same." And Mrs.
Fabian gave a yawn mightier than its predecessors
and sought her favorite nook.</p>

<p>Meantime Eliza Brewster was making restless
sallies from the kitchen to the front room
and gazing over toward the boulder cottage.
She felt sure Phil would inquire about her, and
not let too much time pass before he ran across
the field to Mrs. Wright's.</p>

<p>The dinner dishes were washed and cleared
away and Eliza had on a clean gingham dress
and white apron. Mrs. Wright saw her expectancy.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sidney is a stranger in a strange land,"
she said. "He will be entirely dependent on his
hosts this first day. Why shouldn't we run
over there?" she added with a bright thought.
"That's only island neighborliness."</p>

<p>But Eliza shook her head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>"It would be the very way to begin a new
chapter," urged Mrs. Wright.</p>

<p>Eliza gazed from the window by which she
was sitting. In the evolution to health and
peace which the winter had brought, her causes
of offence had gradually retreated into greater
perspective, and the broad calm outlook which
Mrs. Wright brought to bear on the untoward
as well as the agreeable events of life had
affected the narrow hardness of her own observations.
Nevertheless, to beard the lioness in
her den on the very day of her arrival would be
a feat entirely beyond Eliza; so she only shook
her head again, put on a shade hat, turned up
the skirt of her dress, and went out to weed the
sweet peas.</p>

<p>Thus it was that, with her back to the boulder
cottage and her hands busy with the earth she
loved, she did not hear steps that approached
on the springy turf; and the first notice she had
of the arrival of callers was a man's voice
speaking above her.</p>

<p>"Doing finely, aren't they?" was the remark.</p>

<p>Well she knew the voice. She stepped on her
petticoat in her haste to arise, and two strong
hands went under her arms and lifted her to
her feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Philip!" she said gladly.</p>

<p>He was laughing down at her, and Pluto was
on his shoulder. Kathleen Fabian stood a few
feet away, and Eliza nodded a greeting to her
while she allowed Phil to shake both her hands,
green stains and all. Mrs. Wright, seeing them
from a window, came out to welcome Kathleen
and meet Phil, and the usual felicitations on
the weather and first impressions followed.</p>

<p>"I can see," said Phil, "that I am going to be
miserly of my days. I was just asking Miss
Kathleen if all this beauty is liable to vanish
in a fog-bank to-morrow."</p>

<p>"And she told you not at all liable, I'm sure,"
said Mrs. Wright; "but if it does&mdash;that is the
beauty of the island&mdash;you'll sit before a blazing
open fire and enjoy that quite as well."
Phil shook his head. "The mere amazement
of enjoying a fire at the end of the past week
would, indeed, be absorbing for a while; but I
want to try my hand at this&mdash;this new world."
He looked off at the blue of the crested waves
and the blue of the distant hills. "We are just
on our way to the boat now to send a night
letter to Pat to get him to send on some stuff.
I'm glad you're such a near neighbor, Eliza.
I shall be seeing you often."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll not waste your time now asking you
into the house," said Mrs. Wright, "but some
wet day you must come in and try our fireplace.
When does your brother come, Miss Kathleen?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow; and your niece, Mrs. Wright?"</p>

<p>"In another week, I think. I long to get
hold of the child."</p>

<p>After a few more amenities, in which Eliza
took but little part, except to gaze at Phil with
wistful eyes, the young people started for the
wharf.</p>

<p>"What a bonny young man," said Mrs.
Wright, looking after them.</p>

<p>"Ain't he just about right?" agreed Eliza
proudly. "You see there ain't any philanderin'
there. He just wants to work and work. Here,
Pluto! Kitty, kitty," for the cat was running
after the departing couple. He paused, not
from obedience, but because he saw that their
course lay downhill and he preferred a sheltered
sunny corner by the step.</p>

<p>Phil sent his night letter by the purser of the
boat, and the two went back up the hill. Mrs.
Fabian beckoned to them from the veranda.</p>

<p>"I thought you would be asleep by this time,"
said Kathleen.</p>

<p>"I thought I would, too," returned Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
Fabian. "Come here and let me show you how
careless Cap'n James has been."</p>

<p>They followed her to the shelter of the windbreak
where her favorite hammock hung, and
whirring wings nearly brushed Phil's face as
they entered. The nook was enclosed on two
sides with glass, and Mrs. Fabian pointed to
the snug lofty corner where the swallows had
nested. The young were grown and one had
ventured out upon a beam.</p>

<p>"Oh, oh!" exclaimed Kathleen, with soft
delight. "We're in time for the coming-out
party. Come here, mother, you're frightening
them." And Mrs. Fabian found herself seized
unsympathetically and drawn to a safe distance.</p>

<p>"But I must sleep, Kathleen. I'm exhausted.
I was just dozing off when those creatures
swooped across me chattering. I nearly jumped
out of the hammock. It was a nervous shock."</p>

<p>"I suppose," said the girl, "they were saying,
'Why couldn't those big clumsy human beings
have stayed away just one more day!' You
must be a mascot, Phil, so many fortunate
happenings for your first day."</p>

<p>She was quite unconscious that the name had
slipped out, and the guest smiled and seated
himself on the railing near her while Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
Fabian in a rocking-chair began to be consoled
for her lost nap.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you would prefer to go on exploring,"
added Kathleen, "but I really can't miss
this function."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't miss it for a farm," responded
the guest, eyes fixed on the nest.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian pulled her chair so that its
rockers scraped the boards.</p>

<p>"We must all be still as mice," warned Kathleen
softly.</p>

<p>Her mother looked up at the seething nest
with disfavor. Since her young people considered
the show such a treat, she would be obliged
to edit the lecture she had been preparing for
Captain James. The parent birds flew in and
out in a state of great excitement, and one of
them fed the venturesome little fellow on the
beam, whereupon the others stretched their
necks and vociferated with wide mouths.</p>

<p>"But they're so slow," complained Mrs.
Fabian. "Why don't they fly and be done with
it? I can hardly keep my eyes open."</p>

<p>"They may not go for an hour, or perhaps all
night&mdash;oh, if they are so unkind as to wait
until we're all asleep to-morrow morning!"
said Kathleen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then I don't know that I shall wait," said
Mrs. Fabian.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you'd better not," agreed the girl,
her eyes fixed on the young bird lest he should
elude her. "We're none of us invited to this
party, you see."</p>

<p>Upon this, the venturesome little swallow
appeared to have an attack of homesickness,
for, instead of flying away, he hopped back to
the nest, where he immediately became very
unpopular with his brothers and sisters. Whatever
the spot into which he had this morning
fitted so snugly, it seemed to have disappeared.</p>

<p>"Well, did you ever!" exclaimed Mrs.
Fabian in exasperation. "Why couldn't Phil
climb up there and set them all out on the beam
and take the nest down. I'm sure it would just
help them along."</p>

<p>"Worse than pulling open a rosebud," said
Kathleen.</p>

<p>"Very well, then," returned Mrs. Fabian.
"I shall go upstairs."</p>

<p>No one objecting, she rose and suited the
action to the word; and Kathleen and Phil were
left to a welcome solitude.</p>

<p>The parent swallows soon ceased to notice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
the two large, strange birds perched on the
veranda railing below.</p>

<p>Kathleen had discarded her Tam and as
she sat between Phil and the wind-break, the
sun gave him the red glints in her "reserved
hair."</p>

<p>The tide was going out, but rushing with a
splendid sweep toward the foot of their hill, the
sky had occasional billows of downy white lying
against its clear blue. The sweet wind swept
the fresh grass where daisies were beginning to
appear, and all down the irregular coast-line
of the island the snowy foam broke on rock and
sand.</p>

<p>The iridescent blue of the swallows' backs
and the delicate rose of their breasts lent an
exquisite touch of color, as they flew and
wheeled in the curving flight designed to tempt
the solemn-faced young, crowded so uncomfortably
in the outgrown nest.</p>

<p>Again one struggled out upon the beam. The
cunning parents fed it, while the others begged
in vain. Then again the old birds were away in
airy flight.</p>

<p>"Come out, come out in the sunshine," they
seemed to cry, wheeling back toward the nest.
"Come out to the ecstasy of wind and waves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
The whole world, the world of sea and sky, is
ours."</p>

<p>Kathleen for an instant turned about to her
companion. "Do you see how he can resist?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"Kathleen!" exclaimed Phil.</p>

<p>She turned back, but too late. In that instant
the young bird on the beam had flown.</p>

<p>"They're right there, though," said Phil
excitedly, and indeed the birds kept wheeling
above the bluff, when, wonder of wonders, the
other young ones, struggling to the edge of the
nest as if unable to resist the intoxication of the
sight, flew out into the open.</p>

<p>For a minute the bright air was astir with the
whir of wings. It was impossible to distinguish
the young birds from the old; then they all
alighted on the ridge-pole of a small summer
house which stood on the edge of the bluff.</p>

<p>Kathleen turned to Phil, her hands clasped
on her breast. He thought her enchanted eyes
and smile suggested the unlocking of one of her
inner doors.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, nodding, "I never saw
anything prettier than that."</p>

<p>The girl looked back at the summer house.
The birds were still sitting there all in a row.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
The two watched until again wings were afloat
in the bright air; then they ran down the steps
to see what would be the next resting-place,
and saw the birds alight on posts and netting
about the tennis court. When again they flew,
they disappeared.</p>

<p>Kathleen sighed. "In my next incarnation,"
she said, "I choose to be a swallow on Brewster's
Island."</p>

<p>"Then," said Phil, looking at her radiant
face, "I'm glad I happened to be a man during
your present one."</p>

<p>The open door closed. Phil thought he could
almost hear it click. In an instant the dark
eyes were the reflective ones he had known.</p>

<p>"Thank you kindly, sir," she said. "That
was good fun. Shall we go on now with our
interrupted walk?"</p>

<p>He continued to regard her. "I have an
idea that you have walked enough. Twice up
and down this hill and over to Mrs. Wright's
is enough."</p>

<p>"Ho!" returned the girl lightly, "I walk all
day here."</p>

<p>"Yes, after you have cooled off and slept for
a night or two; but I suggest the hammock
now."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<p>They were standing in the shade and not a
hint of red showed in the girl's soft hair. "There
are weeks to rest in," she said. "We ought to
make the most of this perfect day."</p>

<p>Phil still regarded her. The excitement of
the closing college experiences and the city
heat had left their mark; and he did not know
of other and deeper reasons for her weariness.
The flush of pleasure in the swallow ball had
departed.</p>

<p>"Come," he said decidedly, "let's try the
hammock."</p>

<p>"Really, Mr. Sidney," she answered, smiling,
"I know when I'm tired."</p>

<p>But he proceeded up the veranda steps and
she followed him into the wind-break.</p>

<p>"I'm willing," he said, "to go two steps forward
and one back in my acquaintance with
you; but I draw the line at two back. It
sounded very friendly a few minutes ago when
you called me Phil. I hope you'll see your way
clear to doing it again sometime."</p>

<p>While he spoke, Philip was testing the ropes
of the hammock.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sure I didn't call you Phil," she
said in surprise.</p>

<p>"Let me see. Did I call you Kathleen?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think you did," she replied, a delicate
formality in her voice; "but the circumstances
certainly excused it."</p>

<p>"I hope they will continue to excuse it, for I
feel it coming on that I shall do it again. You
took off Miss Fabian with your tailor gown."
He turned and faced her. "Didn't you?" he
added.</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders, and smiled again.
"Perhaps."</p>

<p>"Then get right down on this couch, little
Kathleen," he ordered, smiling, and after a
moment's hesitation the girl obeyed. He drew
over her the linen coverlet that had lain on a
neighboring chair, and looked, not at her, but
with fascinated eyes through the broad sheets
of glass which guarded the hammock from the
wind.</p>

<p>"Now, if you can feel sober enough to sleep
in this intoxicating place, do so," he said.</p>

<p>Kathleen, propped high on cushions, folded
her arms beneath her head.</p>

<p>"But isn't it questionable courtesy for both
your hostesses to go to sleep, no matter how
sober they may be?" she asked.</p>

<p>"There's another hostess here," he returned,
with a brilliant look down into her uplifted eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I know," said Kathleen.</p>

<p>"My best girl," said Phil, moving out of the
wind-break.</p>

<p>Kathleen smiled. "Yes, I like her, too," she
answered. "I never had a lonely moment on
this island in my life; so I shall not worry about
you. There's another hammock around on the
other side of the porch. Why don't you go to
sleep yourself?"</p>

<p>"Because I'm afraid I should wake up in
Gramercy Park," returned Phil, and, vaulting
over the porch railing, he disappeared from
Kathleen's view.</p>

<p>Walking to the back of the house, he gazed
down at the waters of the cove, then across the
field to the long low white farmhouse where
he had found Eliza, then back again at the
water. "Miss Manning said I should stay here
if I had to live under a rock," he reflected.</p>

<p>One week: one week was all he had planned
for, although Mrs. Fabian had pressed him for
two.</p>

<p>What were two weeks now in prospect? He
knew his aunt would welcome him for an indefinite
stay, but Kathleen doubtless had plans for
guests, and moreover Edgar's advent was but
one little night away. He shuddered at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
prospect of the gilded youth's questions and
comments on his work.</p>

<p>He decided to walk around the edge of the
island. Then he looked back toward Mrs.
Wright's house. He remembered the look of
disappointment in the depths of Eliza's shade
hat when he had paid the fleeting visit on his
way to the wharf.</p>

<p>"I'll go to see her once more," he reflected,
"and have her off my mind, for I'm afraid
I shall forget when I get a little deeper in
here."</p>

<p>Accordingly, he moved off with long swinging
steps through the soft deep grass, and Mrs.
Wright saw him coming. She was sitting with
her book on the rustic bench which took the
place of piazza at the old farmhouse.</p>

<p>"Eliza," she called, "your young man is
coming back."</p>

<p>It was an hour afterward that Mrs. Fabian,
her grudge against the swallows mollified by a
nap, came downstairs to the living-room to
reconnoitre. All was so still that she knew that
either those dull birds were still dawdling, or
else that her young people had seen them off
and were away again.</p>

<p>She peered from a window into the glass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
enclosure, and to her surprise saw her daughter
asleep in the hammock. How slender and pale
looked the sleeping face.</p>

<p>"Poor child. She's worn out, I wonder where
Phil is."</p>

<p>As if the gaze had disturbed the sleeper,
Kathleen turned on her pillow and opened her
eyes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian promptly left the house and
came out to her swinging couch.</p>

<p>"So you took forty winks, too," she said,
casting a glance up at the deserted nest.
"Where's Phil?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," returned Kathleen languidly.
"I scarcely know where I am."</p>

<p>"I hope I didn't wake you, gazing from the
window; but it's no use your trying to sleep
again, for Cap'n James is coming up at last
with the trunks. Kathleen, I've had a bright
idea," added Mrs. Fabian alertly.</p>

<p>The girl stifled a yawn.</p>

<p>"You know Phil won't stay here unless he's
working. I'm going to have him do our portraits
for father's Christmas present!"</p>

<p>Kathleen was wide awake instantly.</p>

<p>"It would cost so much, mother," she said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian stared at her. "What an idea!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
she retorted. "Phil hasn't come to enormous
prices yet!"</p>

<p>"But you would not want to pay him a small
price. It wouldn't be right."</p>

<p>"Since when have you become so economical?"
asked Mrs. Fabian, laughing. "After
Christmas, I must tell your father of this talk.
How he will laugh. You and Edgar should be
shaken up. Phil's sketches of his mother show
his gift for getting likeness. I don't know
whether he has ever painted a portrait, but I
have every confidence in him."</p>

<p>"Then have yours done, dear," said Kathleen.
"You're looking as well as usual, but nothing
would hire me to have my lantern jaws perpetuated."</p>

<p>"Oh, a week or two of this will make you
bloom, child."</p>

<p>"Yes, especially my nose," returned the girl.</p>

<p>Her thoughts were working fast. She had
been happy in the thought that they were now
in the place where neither her mother nor
Edgar could commit themselves to any large
expense. Her father had said that by autumn
he should know where he stood. She could not
say any more, however, for Captain James's
wagon had arrived, and Mrs. Fabian went to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
see to the disposition of the trunks and to give
her caretaker explicit low-voiced directions as
to examining for and eliminating any and all
birds' nests found in future on the premises,
and at last she brought him around to the wind-break
to point out the one he was to remove
now, with all its traces, at the earliest possible
moment.</p>

<p>Kathleen, still lying, her hands clasped under
her head, looked up at him with a smile.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad you didn't notice that nest any
sooner, Cap'n James," she said. "You might
have disturbed it."</p>

<p>Captain James chewed a wisp of grass and
favored the girl with a wink.</p>

<p>"It wasn't like you," said Mrs. Fabian,
with elaborately gentle rebuke, "not to have
this wind-break cleaner. Look at the windows."</p>

<p>"I had Betsy Eaton wash 'em on the outside,"
said the captain imperturbably, and winked at
Kathleen again.</p>

<p>"It was fine of you, Cap'n James," she
laughed. "They flew to-day, and I was at the
party."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian looked from one to the other of
the laughing ones, in injured dignity.</p>

<p>"Very well," she said at last; "now, if you're<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
quite sure it won't disturb the plans of man or
beast, Cap'n James, I'd like to have this wind-break
cleaned."</p>

<p>"'Nuff said," returned the man, and once
more grinning down at the girl's laughing face,
he went back to his helper sitting on the wagon.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">ELIZA SURRENDERS</p>


<p>Eliza had begun some work in the kitchen
which she could not at once leave when Mrs.
Wright called her, so the latter brought Phil
into the house.</p>

<p>"No wonder Eliza didn't expect me twice a
day," he said. "What an interesting old place
this is."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Mrs. Wright; "and we are
making the most of the few days that it will
still be all ours. Miss Jane Foster, who owns
it, comes almost immediately to take possession
and receive her summer boarders."</p>

<p>"But won't that be a rest for you?"</p>

<p>"Scarcely; for Eliza has taken such a laboring
oar that I live in the lap of luxury, so far as
work is concerned."</p>

<p>Eliza came in, in time to hear this statement.
"Don't you believe it, Mr. Philip. She's the
busy bee of the house; but we've both had just
enough to do."</p>

<p>"Eliza!" exclaimed Phil, approaching and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
taking both her hard hands. "Why, I didn't
half see you in that shade hat! You look like
a new being."</p>

<p>Eliza laughed and colored under the scrutiny.
Her added pounds had distributed themselves
comfortably and becomingly. She did, indeed,
bear little resemblance to the haggard creature
of the autumn.</p>

<p>"Why, let me look at you!" went on the
artist gladly. "You've robbed me of a whole
lot of good material. If you posed for me now,
it would amount to nothing more than the
portrait of a lady."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wright laughed, well pleased, and
amused, too, at the embarrassed manner in
which Eliza pulled away her hands.</p>

<p>"But you stay on here, I suppose, just the
same," said Phil, turning back to his hostess.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. I've taken a room for Violet, my
niece, and Miss Foster has made a business
arrangement with Eliza to be her helper, so the
only great difference will be the arrival of new
people."</p>

<p>Considerations immediately ran through
Phil's head of this home as a possibility for
his prolonged stay. Second thought, however,
pictured the going and coming of summer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
boarders and the impossibility of privacy.
Besides, he could not afford it.</p>

<p>He picked up a small black book which his
eye had caught lying beside the Bible on Mrs.
Wright's table.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he said, raising his eyebrows and
looking at her with a smile.</p>

<p>"Do you know it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"My mother lives by it," he returned.</p>

<p>"Then her boy does, I'm sure," said Mrs.
Wright.</p>

<p>"He tries to," answered Phil. "I was just
thinking now of our philosophy, and trying to
know that, if it's right for me to stay on this
island, it will come to pass. I feel as if I could
do a lot of work here."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Fabian will have too much of a houseful?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not; but there couldn't be any
independence in that; and I couldn't bring
paint rags into her spick-and-span cottage."</p>

<p>"Take board here," suggested Mrs. Wright.</p>

<p>Phil shook his head. "I don't want to give
the price for a long pull. Miss Manning prophesied
that I should live under a rock rather
than leave. I'll go rock-hunting some day."</p>

<p>"There must be some way, Mr. Philip!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
exclaimed Eliza, who had listened attentively.
The intensity of her manner reminded Phil of
other days.</p>

<p>"You should have more stables on the island,"
he returned. "It's very thoughtless of you."</p>

<p>"We can all help him, remember, Eliza,"
said Mrs. Wright&mdash;"you know I've told you&mdash;by
thinking right."</p>

<p>"Goodness knows, I'd think anything that'd
keep him here," returned Eliza bluntly. "He's
as white as a candle, and it makes me sick to
think o' the perspiration runnin' into his eyes.
What d'you want me to think? I'll say the
moon's made o' green cheese, if it'll do any
good."</p>

<p>"No, it only does good to think the truth.
It's law. You remember how I've told you
that we live under laws and they aren't material
ones? Our thoughts are our whole concern.
Get thought right, and action takes care of
itself. You're stopping up one of the channels
through which good can come to you and
yours. You consider Mr. Sidney one of yours,
I'm sure."</p>

<p>Eliza averted her eyes uncomfortably.</p>

<p>"Yes," went on Mrs. Wright, smiling, "I'm
speaking right out in meeting, because you've<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
told me that Mr. Sidney knows of your antagonism."</p>

<p>"She's talkin' about the barrel," remarked
Eliza dryly.</p>

<p>"Oh, the barrel!" laughed Phil. "I'd forgotten
about that. So has Aunt Isabel, I fancy."</p>

<p>"I'll bet a cookie she went to your room and
tried to get it," said Eliza, eyeing him shrewdly.</p>

<p>Phil nodded. "Yes, she did."</p>

<p>Eliza struck her hands together with satisfaction.
"I'd give more'n a cookie to have
seen her face when she got there," she said
triumphantly.</p>

<p>"No, I wasn't talking about the barrel,"
continued Mrs. Wright. "That is your own
affair: whether you care to keep those family
treasures or to give them up. I was speaking in
general about your forgiving Mrs. Fabian as
you would be forgiven, and banishing discord
from the atmosphere. How can you tell how
much sunlight that cloud is holding back from
this dear boy of Mrs. Ballard's?"</p>

<p>Eliza stared into space and bit her lip. The
three were standing in a group near the table.</p>

<p>"Well, sit down, anyway," she said briefly,
and they did so.</p>

<p>Phil saw that there was method in Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
Wright's choosing of this particular opportunity
to make a point. Hers was the face of a
peacemaker and it was easy to see what pain
she would find in discord.</p>

<p>Now she turned to Phil and asked him about
his father and mother, and he told her of the
mountains, and his periodical longing for them.
This place, he added, gave him a similar sense of
exhilaration. It seemed as if he were breathing
again for the first time since November.</p>

<p>"You've got to stay," said Eliza nervously;
"that's all there is about it."</p>

<p>He smiled. "The bark on a tree isn't as
tight as I am," he replied. "I've planned to
make my money do just so much."</p>

<p>"'With God all things are possible,'" remarked
Mrs. Wright.</p>

<p>"Yes," he laughed; "I'm going to look for a
cave with a skylight."</p>

<p>Eliza's thoughts were painfully busy. The
constant dropping of the winter had made an
impression on their adamant. Supposing there
should be anything in what Mrs. Wright just
said. Supposing God were to punish her for
continuing to hate an enemy; punish her by
holding back some benefit from her dear one's
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protg</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<p>She stirred around in her chair during a
pause. "I've been thinkin' to-day," she said
carelessly, "that I didn't exactly know what I
was goin' to do with that barrel. I've got to
bring it down from upstairs before Jennie gets
here."</p>

<p>"Let me do that for you," said Phil quickly.
"I've been honing to lift something heavy all
the afternoon. I've felt as if I could lick my
weight in wild cats ever since dinner."</p>

<p>He started up with such eagerness that Eliza
mechanically arose and went to the stairs, Phil
following; and Mrs. Wright, a hopeful light in
her eyes, looked on.</p>

<p>"We've got to get these rooms ready for
boarders," explained Eliza as they went up to
the second story. "It's real clever of you to
lug the barrel down for me."</p>

<p>Phil smiled covertly as he recognized the old
bone of contention with the flourishing address
he had executed, and he steered it down the
narrow stairs successfully.</p>

<p>Eliza had preceded him nimbly.</p>

<p>As soon as she reached the living-room, Mrs.
Wright approached her.</p>

<p>"Where are you going to put it?" she asked,
looking wistfully at Eliza.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, anywhere," replied the latter with
bravado.</p>

<p>"Jane wouldn't like it in here, of course,"
remarked Mrs. Wright.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose I have a right to my own
room, haven't I?" Eliza retorted sharply.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be very much in the way,
dear? You have it fixed so pretty in there."</p>

<p>"Well, what's the reason it can't stand in the
shed?" asked Eliza, with defiance.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wright shook her head. "'Where moth
and rust doth corrupt,'" she said slowly.</p>

<p>Phil now had the barrel down, and was standing
beside it, waiting.</p>

<p>"Whither away, now?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Eliza," said Mrs. Wright, "there's a wheelbarrow
out in the shed."</p>

<p>Eliza colored and bit her lip. "Do you
know," she said, turning to Phil, "Mrs. Wright
wants me to give those things to Mrs. Fabian?"</p>

<p>"Well, it would tickle Aunt Isabel almost to
pieces," he admitted.</p>

<p>"Do you see any reason or justice in it?"</p>

<p>Phil smiled. "It's a luxury to do an unreasonable
thing once in a while," he answered.</p>

<p>"If I thought it would do you the least bit
o' good," said Eliza, "I'd do anything. I'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
find a white hair in a black dog's tail and burn
it by the light o' the moon, at midnight," she
added scornfully; "but unluckily I ain't superstitious."</p>

<p>Phil glanced at Mrs. Wright's sweet, earnest
face, and understood that she had thought
deeply of the prospect of discord between the
two cottages.</p>

<p>"Come on, Eliza," he said, with boyish
enthusiasm, "it would be great fun to see Aunt
Isabel's face. Even if you were after revenge,
coals of fire are a mighty punishment, and if
you're only being magnanimous and letting bygones
be bygones why, who knows but it will
be the means of my finding the cave with the
skylight?"</p>

<p>Eliza turned away suddenly from his laughing
eyes. "All right," she said, "take it! I'll
show you where the wheelbarrow is; and when
you've got it across that hubbly field you won't
be looking for wild cats to fight."</p>

<p>"Oh, but you'll steady the barrel."</p>

<p>"Will I! Well, you can guess again, young
man." Eliza's eyes flashed.</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw," he said. "Don't make two
bites of a cherry. If the barrel goes, you
go."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>Eliza met his gay, determined look with
exasperation.</p>

<p>"This is persecution," she declared angrily;
then added beseechingly, "Don't make me,
Mr. Philip."</p>

<p>"I couldn't let you miss it," he returned.
"We have the white hair of the black dog, but,
you see, we have to burn it."</p>

<p>Eliza looked appealingly toward Mrs. Wright,
whose face was expectant.</p>

<p>"Dear Eliza," she said.</p>

<p>"Don't you 'dear' me," snapped Eliza.
"Come this way, Mr. Philip."</p>

<p>She marched out of the room, and Mrs.
Wright seized and squeezed Phil's hand as he
passed. He gave her a laughing look.</p>

<p>Soon the march across the field began. Mrs.
Wright watched them from the window. Eliza,
her shade hat tied primly down beneath her
chin, steadied the barrel when Phil's route
encountered too great an irregularity.</p>

<p>"Dear martyr," thought Mrs. Wright, who
had caught a glimpse of her companion's expression
as they moved away. "She does love
that beautiful boy. I hope her reward will come
soon."</p>

<p>Captain James had just driven back down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
the hill after bringing up the trunks when Phil
and Eliza reached the shaven sward about the
Fabian cottage.</p>

<p>Phil dropped the wheelbarrow at the steps.</p>

<p>"Wait here a minute, Eliza, till I reconnoitre,"
he said. "This was a sleeping castle
when I left."</p>

<p>"Now, if they're asleep&mdash;" said Eliza, hastily
and hopefully; but Phil had disappeared
quietly around the corner which led to the windbreak.
As he approached, the sound of voices
mingled with the tide, so he advanced with
confidence.</p>

<p>Kathleen was sitting on the edge of the hammock
facing her mother, who looked around as
Phil came in view.</p>

<p>"Here we are, awake at last," she said.
"Where have you been? How well you look!
You have quite a flush."</p>

<p>He came close to her. "I've been helping
Eliza Brewster bring you a present," he said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian was all attention, but a look of
resentment spread over her countenance.</p>

<p>"She is here with me," went on Phil, low and
rapidly. "It means a good deal, you know. I
hope you will be very nice to her."</p>

<p>Kathleen, alertly comprehending, rose from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
the hammock and moved past her mother and
around to where Eliza stood by the steps,
schooling herself.</p>

<p>"You can't get out of a barrel what ain't in
it," she reflected. "'Tain't any use tappin' a
barrel o' vinegar and bein' mad 'cause maple
syrup don't come out."</p>

<p>"You scarcely spoke to me this morning,"
said Kathleen pleasantly, "you were so glad to
see Mr. Sidney."</p>

<p>Eliza shook hands awkwardly. Kathleen
Fabian seemed even to her prejudice to ring
true. "She don't inherit vinegar," thought
Eliza. "I don't know why I shouldn't give her
the benefit o' the doubt. Maybe she is maple
clear through."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian now came in stately fashion
around the corner into view. Her eyes caught
sight of the barrel and glistened. It was almost
impossible to believe that&mdash;</p>

<p>"How do you do, Eliza?" she said, in mellifluous
tones. "Mr. Sidney tells me you wish to
see me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, about this barrel," interrupted Eliza,
with nervous haste. "It's some o' the things
Mrs. Ballard left me that I thought you'd
enjoy havin'. It's her silver and china, just as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
I packed 'em in New York. I haven't taken
out anything."</p>

<p>"Why, really, Eliza, do you know, I appreciate
that very much," said Mrs. Fabian graciously,
"and I shall enjoy them far more here
than I could in New York. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes,'m," said Eliza, "I've got to hurry
back to get supper. We have a real early
tea."</p>

<p>"No, not until you've come in and seen
where Aunt Mary's things are to be. I really
couldn't allow you to go without sitting down
a minute to rest."</p>

<p>"No, no, thank you," said Eliza, more hurriedly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you did come in and see the cottage
while it was being prepared for us."</p>

<p>"No, ma'am," returned Eliza, arrested in
flight. "I've never been as near to it as this."</p>

<p>"I wish you would come in, then," said
Kathleen. "We think it's very pretty."</p>

<p>So Eliza yielded, and Phil followed her into
the house, showing her the views from the windows,
and before she came out again she had
exchanged remarks with Mrs. Fabian on the
increased price of lobsters and other practical
subjects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span></p>

<p>"Really quite human," commented Mrs.
Fabian when the guest had departed.</p>

<p>"And how well she looks," said Kathleen.</p>

<p>"Now," remarked her mother complacently,
"you see my own has come to me. I knew
Eliza was half-crazy last autumn. I just anticipate
pulling over those funny old things."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Phil and Eliza were retracing
their steps across the field.</p>

<p>"There! that didn't hurt much, did it?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"I haven't got much use for her," replied
Eliza, "but I do believe Kathleen Fabian's a
sensible girl."</p>

<p>"Our friend Edgar is coming to-morrow,"
remarked Phil.</p>

<p>Eliza looked up at him shrewdly from beneath
the shade hat. "Is that the reason you
want to be a cave man?"</p>

<p>Phil laughed. "Perhaps it's one," he admitted.
"He's a rather&mdash;well&mdash;pervasive
person, we'll say. I need elbow room to work.
Isn't this a great place, Eliza?" The speaker's
eyes swept the surroundings. "You're farther
from the sea than the Fabians. You have a
grand orchard, I see," added Phil, laughing; "or
does it belong to that little cottage over there?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where? Oh, you mean the chicken-house?"</p>

<p>"Chicken-house! Are the hens here so high-toned
they have to have windows besides their
roosts? There are places out West where the
reason for the cows giving little milk is said to
be because they become so enchanted with the
scenery that they forget to eat. I suppose those
hens go up to the second floor to watch the sunset."</p>

<p>Phil looked curiously at the little story and a
half building guarded by the balm-of-Gilead
trees.</p>

<p>"Law, there ain't any hens there," replied
Eliza. "A pig wouldn't live there now. I'm
itchin' to burn it down, it's so dirty."</p>

<p>"Nobody lives there?" asked Phil.</p>

<p>"No, not since Granny Foster that it was
built for. She scared us children out of our wits
in her time, and I s'pose we pestered her, 'cause
of course we was imps and couldn't keep away.
We'd rather play tricks on her than eat, but
only a few got their courage up to do more than
knock on the door and run away. That door!
My! to think I can walk up to it and open it.
It seems wonderful even now."</p>

<p>"Let's go and open it," said Phil, eagerly,
beginning to stride in that direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no, Mr. Philip, keep away. It's too
dirty and musty in there for words. Jennie
quit keepin' hens a long time ago, and I guess
she just let it rot away there, 'cause 'twa'n't
worth cleanin'!"</p>

<p>"Oh, but I want to see where little Eliza was
scared," persisted Phil, hurrying so fast that
Eliza was obliged to run after him. She stood
away a little, though, with her long nose lifted
while he opened the door and his eager eyes
swept the interior.</p>

<p>"Don't you go in there, oh, don't, Mr.
Philip," she said. "I can tell you just what there
is, a parlor and a kitchen, and a rough kind o'
steps that go upstairs where there's only half a
floor. It would make a grand bonfire. I wish
Jennie'd let us."</p>

<p>"She owns it, does she? The woman that's
going to keep your boarding-house?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; all this land's hers and the
orchard."</p>

<p>Phil closed the dingy door and walked around
back of the cottage. Apparently, Granny Foster
had liked the view of the open ocean, contrary
to the taste of most of the women on the
island, who had good reason to dread its mighty
power. At any rate, while the front of the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
house grew straight out of the grass, the back
had once boasted a piazza, which had fallen
away and capsized in the field which ran down
to the water's edge.</p>

<p>"What a view your old lady had!" said Phil,
standing still and listening to the rustling leaves
that whispered in the orchard.</p>

<p>"'Tis a sightly place," said Eliza.</p>

<p>The artist looked with starry eyes over the
little cottage again and then at his companion.</p>

<p>"It's wonderful," he said.</p>

<p>"'M-h'm," agreed Eliza; "and it'll do you all
the good in the world if you can only stay
here."</p>

<p>Phil's radiant smile beamed upon her.</p>

<p>"Why, I'm going to stay. Can't you see
what I'm thinking?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Eliza, staring at him curiously.</p>

<p>"I've found my cave." He waved his hand
toward the chicken-house. "Do you think
Jennie'll let me have it?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Philip!" exclaimed Eliza distractedly,
clasping her hard hands as his meaning broke
upon her. "There ain't any use to talk about it
even! How could I ever clean that place for
you!"</p>

<p>"I shan't let you touch it! Hurrah!" ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>claimed
the artist, turning a somersault in the
grass and coming right-side up so suddenly that
Eliza blinked.</p>

<p>"Oh, my sorrows and cares!" she mourned;
"it's the craziest idea"&mdash;</p>

<p>"When, when did you say she's coming?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow. Dear, dear!" Eliza was half
laughing and half crying.</p>

<p>"Then I've only to wait one night. Oh, it's
too good to be true, like everything else that
happens to me." Another flight of long arms
and legs accompanied by a whoop of joy, and
once more Phil was right-side up and catching
Eliza by the arm.</p>

<p>"Let's go and tell Mrs. Wright," he exclaimed,
and hurried his companion toward the
farmhouse, where Mrs. Wright was sitting on
the rustic bench.</p>

<p>"He's crazy," declared Eliza. "Tell him so.
There must be lots o' better places. That
wouldn't smell good in a thousand years."</p>

<p>But when Phil had divulged his great plan,
Mrs. Wright nodded.</p>

<p>"The very thing," she said. "I'm sure Jane
will let you use it free, and be glad to have it
put in shape. Then you can take as many or
as few meals here as you like."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>Her calm, happy approval closed Eliza's lips
in a desperate silence.</p>

<p>"I must rush back to my hostesses," said
Phil. "Hurrah for us, Eliza. I'll go to every
boat to meet Jennie."</p>

<p>He started across the field on a long, swinging
run.</p>

<p>"Splendid boy," mused Mrs. Wright, aloud,
looking after him.</p>

<p>Eliza had sunk on the bench, dumb.</p>

<p>"Now, then," her friend turned to her; "see
how you've helped him."</p>

<p>Eliza's eyes snapped. "Do you mean to
say," she retorted, speaking fast and defiantly,
"that if I hadn't gone over to Mrs. Fabian's
and given her the dishes, he wouldn't 'a' found
that chicken-house?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Wright smiled and shook her head.</p>

<p>"There's only one thing I know, Eliza," she
said with deliberation, "and that is that Love
is Omnipotence, and that in every problem we
mortals have the choice of looking down into
error and discord, or up into Truth and Harmony."</p>

<p>Eliza's breath caught in her throat, and she
felt so strangely stirred that she rose abruptly
and went into the house.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">THE SINGER</p>


<p>The combination of at last having a definite
aim in life, and the cutting rebuke received in
his father's library, had caused Edgar Fabian
to wake up.</p>

<p>On the hot morning when he took the train
for Portland, he even looked a little pale from
the unwonted vigil of the night before. As he
tossed on his bed in the small hours, he had
fretted at the heat, but it was not temperature
that made him survey the causes for his father's
drastic words; and he recalled the emotion
which Kathleen had not been able to conceal
with a sort of affectionate dismay. Kathleen
was a good sort, after all. She had worked for
him, he knew, and mitigated the situation so
far as she could.</p>

<p>"Father wants to be shown, does he?" he
thought, clenching his teeth. "Well, I'll show
him. I will."</p>

<p>His soul was still smarting when he boarded
the train in the breathless station and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
porter carried his suitcase to his chair in the day
coach.</p>

<p>A group of girls were standing about the
neighboring seat, but he did not regard them.
One of them observed him, and for her the thermometer
suddenly went up ten degrees more.</p>

<p>"Hurry girls, you must go," she said, softly
and peremptorily, moving with them to the
end of the car. "How I wish you didn't have
to!" Then, as they reached the door, the flushed
one squeezed their arms. "That was Mr. Fabian,
girls!" she added.</p>

<p>"Where? Where?" they ejaculated, looking
wildly about.</p>

<p>"Back there in the very next chair to mine.
Oh, get off, dears."</p>

<p>They regarded the rosy face.</p>

<p>"Slyboots!" exclaimed Roxana.</p>

<p>"Indeed, I knew nothing of it!" declared
Violet.</p>

<p>"Very well." Regina spoke in hasty exhortation.
"The sun shines hard enough for you
to make all the hay there is. I've a great mind
to throw a pump after you!"</p>

<p>The friends slipped off just in time, and
Violet waved them a laughing adieu; then her
face sobered while her eyes shone. She could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
not go back to her place at once. The combination
was more than flesh and blood could endure
nonchalantly: her work finished, she starting
for the island earlier than she had hoped, with
the joyful anticipation of surprising her aunt,
and, instead of journeying alone, to find <em>the</em>
man beside her.</p>

<p>Violet was extremely indignant with herself
for calling Edgar <em>the</em> man. Never one thing had
he done to deserve it. There was no one on earth
to whom in reality she was more indifferent.
She allowed conductors, porter, passengers,
and luggage to stumble by and over her in the
narrow passage while she reflected upon the
utter uncongeniality of herself and Edgar
Fabian; the gulf fixed between their lots, their
habits, their tastes. A man who was so artificial
that he couldn't like Brewster's Island.
How could any girl with genuine feeling do
more than politely endure him!</p>

<p>Violet finally, having been bumped and trodden
on until she realized that she was being
scowled at by all comers, stepped under the
portire into the ladies' room and looked in the
glass. The neatest and trimmest of visions
regarded her.</p>

<p>"I don't care a snap how I look, but I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
dreadfully warm," she thought, and taking a
powder-puff from her mesh bag, she raised her
veil and cooled her crimson cheeks and dabbed
her nose; then she pinned the veil back closely;
and gave her bright eyes a challenging and
warning gaze.</p>

<p>"If you dare!" she murmured, then moved
out into the aisle again and sought her place.</p>

<p>Edgar had hung up his hat, his back was to
the car, and his gloomy eyes gazed out of the
window. Violet sank into her chair, turning its
back to him. "There!" she thought sternly,
"we can ride this way all day. There's not the
slightest necessity for recognition."</p>

<p>An hour passed and this seemed only too
true. She took up the copy of "Life" which
Roxana had left with her, and looked through
it with more grim determination than is usually
brought to bear upon that enlivening sheet.</p>

<p>Everything continued to be quiet behind her.
She wondered if Edgar had gone to sleep; but
what was it to her what he was doing? She
became conscious that there were more strokes
on the illustrations than the artists had intended.</p>

<p>"I must take off my veil!" she reflected.</p>

<p>Of course, no girl can take off her veil and hat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
without making some stir. She hoped she
should not attract her neighbor's attention by
these movements. She didn't.</p>

<p>At last all was comfortably arranged, and
she picked up the periodical which had been
Regina's offering and looked at her chatelaine
watch, wondering how much time had been
wasted already.</p>

<p>She never before heard of a man who stayed
in his seat on the train unless he was an invalid.
One would think he would at least walk up and
down once in a while. She turned her chair a
little away from the window and toward the
aisle. A fat man who was her vis--vis glanced
at her, and finding the glance most satisfactory,
looked again, long enough to make her aware
of him. She swung slowly back toward the
window, but not so far that she could not command
movements in the aisle.</p>

<p>Of course, Mr. Fabian was asleep. He had
probably been turning night into day in the
festivities which society events had recorded
as preceding Mrs. Larrabee's departure for
Europe.</p>

<p>The thought was a tonic. She loved to realize
how insignificant and selfish was the life this
young man led; making him not worth a second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
thought to a womanly woman who scorned to
associate with any man to whom she could not
look up, and he hadn't shaved off that blond
pointed mustache, either; how she despised
mustaches.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why, Miss Manning." The interested
greeting broke forth directly above her,
and she started and looked up straight into the
scorned mustache. "How wonderful," said
Edgar. "I was just wondering who liked the
'Century' better upside down than right-side
up; then I noticed that whoever it was had
pretty hair, so I looked again and saw it was
you."</p>

<p>"I"&mdash;stammered Violet, blushing violently
and dropping the magazine,&mdash;"I think I was
so sleepy I didn't know&mdash;I&mdash;where did you
spring from?"</p>

<p>"Just now from the smoking-room, but I'm
here, right here in this chair next to you. Can
you beat it? Are you for the island?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I, too. Great that we should meet. Let me
turn your chair around. I was never so glad to
see you."</p>

<p>"Why? Were you bored?" Violet's tone
and manner of courteous indifference were so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
excellent that they deceived the fat man, who
regarded the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">contretemps</i> over the top of his
paper and felt quite chivalrously impatient of
the "fresh guy" who had interrupted the
young traveller's meditations; and heartily
commiserated the girl for the coincidence which
had made her the prey of an acquaintance.</p>

<p>"No, not more bored than usual," replied
Edgar, having arranged the chairs at the best
angle for sociability, "but if you talk to me I
may forget how I want to smoke."</p>

<p>Violet raised her eyebrows. "Oh, I'm to be
useful and not ornamental," she said with an
icily sweet smile.</p>

<p>"You can't help being ornamental," said
Edgar, drumming nervously on the arm of his
chair. "There, that's the last compliment I'm
going to give you. I warn you. I'm a bear
to-day. I'm sorry for you." The speaker was
pale and Violet laid both pallor and nervousness
to the door of the vivacious lady about to
sail for foreign shores.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied, looking at him blandly. "I
saw that your charming friend Mrs. Larrabee is
leaving."</p>

<p>Edgar looked around quickly. "Yes, she's
leaving. I bade her good-bye last night."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is that why you wish to smoke all the time?"
asked Violet, with cooing gentleness.</p>

<p>"All the time! Great Scott! I've had just
one cigarette since I got up."</p>

<p>"You said you had just come from the smoking-room."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I hadn't been in. That's the
trouble. I'm cutting it out."</p>

<p>"Why? Have you made a virtuous vow?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I'm in no mood for joking this
morning." Edgar frowned and twisted his
mustache.</p>

<p>Violet spoke with laughing sweetness.</p>

<p>"Nothing is more easy than to escape it,"
she said, and deftly turned her chair with its
back to him.</p>

<p>He seized it by the arm and twisted it around
again.</p>

<p>"No, you don't," he said. "Forgive me; you
know the stereotyped advice to newly married
couples about the two bears; 'bear and forbear,'
don't you? Well, remember it, please."</p>

<p>"I don't see the parallel," said Violet coolly;
"and anyway, is the advice directed entirely
at the woman?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm bearing with you now for turning
your back to me, you who are going to teach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
me to clog when we reach the island." He gave
her the smile designed to melt the icy heart.</p>

<p>"In consideration," returned Violet, "for a
continuous ripple of song."</p>

<p>Edgar suddenly looked important, and gazed
out of the window. Then he turned back to the
girl who was regarding him.</p>

<p>"What do you think of my voice&mdash;honestly?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"I think it is one of the most beautiful I have
ever heard," she answered promptly.</p>

<p>He nodded slowly. "I fished to some purpose,
didn't I," he said gravely. "Well, since
you really think that, and I've always admired
your sincerity, you may be interested to know
that I have given up business in order to cultivate
it."</p>

<p>There being nobody present who was employed
in Mr. Fabian's office, the dignity of this
statement was not impaired by hilarity; and
Violet, greatly impressed, clasped her hands.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so glad," she said. "All your
friends will be so glad."</p>

<p>Had she known it, she might have added,
"and all your business associates"; but neither
word nor look minimized the enthusiasm of the
moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span></p>

<p>Enough of Violet's faith and admiration
shone in her speaking eyes to fall like balm on
Edgar's wounded soul. He began to heal under
it; began to mount into his wonted atmosphere
of assurance.</p>

<p>"I've been studying ever since January with
Mazzini. I've kept quiet about it because,
after all,"&mdash;the speaker spread his hands in a
modest gesture,&mdash;"he might be mistaken in
his extremely enthusiastic estimate."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no!" said Violet earnestly. Edgar
drank more healing from the fountain of her
eyes. "What shall you do? Go into opera?"</p>

<p>"I don't know yet," replied the aspirant,
with the air of one who was holding Mr. Hammerstein
in the hollow of his hand, uncertain
whether to throw him over or to be gracious.
"I'm very much alone in this," he added,
meeting the girl's gaze with an air of confidence.
"Of course my father and mother and
sister are willing; in fact, they are pleased that
I have undertaken this."</p>

<p>"Think of giving up smoking!" exclaimed
Violet. "What a sacrifice that means to a man!
I should think your family would see by that
how in earnest you are."</p>

<p>"Yes, they believe I am in earnest; but when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
one in a family is keenly temperamental and
the others are not, there are only certain planes
on which they can meet, you understand?"</p>

<p>"By all means!" Violet understood perfectly.</p>

<p>"I have certain ideas that I never divulge to
them. They would only laugh. What would it
mean to them if I were to say that I had purple
moods&mdash;and red moods&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Probably nothing," returned Violet, quickly
and with close attention. "Black and green
and blue are the only common ones."</p>

<p>Edgar looked at her suspiciously. Had the
fountain of healing admiration vanished, and
was she laughing at him? Not at all. She was
regarding him with a respect and awe which he
could not doubt.</p>

<p>"Explain the others to me. Do you think
you could?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not," he answered gently, "but,
well, for instance, while in the purple mood I
could never learn to clog. Does that mean anything
to you?"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," returned Violet fervently. "I
see. You would be too intense."</p>

<p>"Exactly. In the red, I might. It would
depend on which way it took me."</p>

<p>His listener nodded earnestly. "Yes, yes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
A berserk rage is red. They always see red in
books."</p>

<p>"But so is a glowing sunset red," said Edgar.
"The red of joy. I see you understand. Oh,
what rest it is to have people understand!"</p>

<p>Violet glowed. Some memory recurred to
her. "Does Mr. Sidney know about this?"
she asked.</p>

<p>Edgar shrugged his shoulders. "He is at the
island with my people. They may have told
him."</p>

<p>The girl's rosy lips set. "Now," she wondered,
"would he chuckle over foolish sketches
of conceited robins! At all events, he would
very soon give it up."</p>

<p>The two travellers had a wonderful day together,
undaunted by heat and cinders.</p>

<p>Edgar gave Violet as dainty a luncheon as circumstances
permitted, and when they reached
Portland too late for the last boat, he left her
at her hotel with the promise to call for her in
the morning.</p>

<p>The boat they took next day was the same
one which bore Miss Jane Foster to her summer
home; so when, after the cooling ride down the
bay, they arrived at Brewster's Island and saw
Philip Sidney and Eliza Brewster waiting with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
Kathleen, Edgar pointed Eliza out to Violet
with amusement.</p>

<p>"I wonder how Sidney enjoys his shadow,"
he remarked, "I suppose she's trailing him all
over the place."</p>

<p>As Mrs. Wright had no expectation of her
niece's early arrival, Eliza looked out with indifference
from under her closely tied shade hat
at the fair girl in neat tailor gown who stood
by Edgar as the boat pulled in; and the exclamation
of her companions was her first intimation
that it was Violet Manning.</p>

<p>Eliza stood quietly amid the greeting and
laughing and explanations of the young people,
and was introduced to Miss Manning; then she
caught sight of Jane Foster, for whose eagerly
expected face Phil had been gazing over the
heads of everybody, notwithstanding that he
had no idea what she looked like.</p>

<p>"Better go home with the Fabians and come
to us later," she suggested, speaking low to him.</p>

<p>"Guess again, Eliza," he returned softly.
Then he turned to Kathleen. "I'll not interrupt
your first <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tte--tte</i> with your brother.
I'll walk up the hill with Miss Manning and see
Mrs. Wright's face when we appear."</p>

<p>Kathleen nodded her agreement, and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
they all reached the road, she opened her eyes
at the manner in which her brother parted from
Violet. Neither spoke. They clasped hands
and exchanged a look, which was, to say the
least, unusual.</p>

<p>"You and Miss Manning seemed to be giving
each other the grip," she laughed when the two
began their ascent slowly. "Do you belong to
the same secret society?"</p>

<p>His reply was still more amazing. "We
do," he answered impressively. "You guessed
right the very first time. That girl has more
sense in a minute than the general run have in
years."</p>

<p>"I always liked her," returned Kathleen,
wondering.</p>

<p>As for Philip, he carried Violet's suitcase and
Miss Foster's bag and received the jubilant
chatter of the young girl with appreciative
assent, casting sheep's eyes all the way up the
hill at the modest owner of the chicken-house,
who little suspected that the big handsome
young man who was carrying her bag cared
more to get one monosyllable from her than
for all the pleasant things this pretty girl might
say to him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wright, busy taking Eliza's place in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
preparations for the early dinner, was not
watching for the arrival, and the first warning
she had of Violet's presence was two vigorous
arms being thrown around her neck.</p>

<p>Her first impression was that Jane Foster
had an attack of emotional insanity, but in a
moment she was returning the embrace.</p>

<p>"My little girl, what does this mean?" she
cried joyously. "Not a flower in your room.
Nothing ready."</p>

<p>"Yes, dinner is. I can smell it. Oh, Aunt
Amy, <em>you</em> and vacation, and no city and no
heat, and the divine island smell, and twenty-four
hours in the day, and seven days in the
week. Oh, it's too much happiness!" And
Violet danced back into the living-room straight
into the arms of Mr. Wright, who had just been
washing his hands for dinner.</p>

<p>"Right you are, Violet. No place like the
island," he said heartily, while Eliza and Jane
Foster regarded the newcomer with calm wonder.
How could they know the glamour that
was gilding all?</p>

<p>Phil was so preoccupied, he scarcely noticed
the girl's antics. His eyes were fixed with the
most lover-like eagerness on Jane Foster's serious
countenance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span></p>

<p>"Had you better ask her or I, Eliza?" he
murmured, under cover of Violet's laughter.</p>

<p>"You'd better not trust me," replied Eliza
darkly, upon which Phil interrupted Miss
Foster as she was starting for the stairs.</p>

<p>"Might I speak to you one moment before
you go up?" he asked.</p>

<p>Her calm eyes turned to him. "You want
board?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not exactly. Would you mind coming
outside a minute. I'd like to see you alone."</p>

<p>Jane Foster looked into the brilliant face,
wondering; then she followed him outside the
door. Perhaps he wanted to buy the farmhouse.
She had made some calculation before she
reached the rustic bench; but his first words
dashed her expectations.</p>

<p>"Miss Foster, I'm an artist and like them
all, at first, I haven't any money. I've been
wondering if you'd let me camp down in your
chicken-house and do some work. What rent
would you want?"</p>

<p>Jane Foster regarded him calmly. "'T ain't
habitable," she said.</p>

<p>"I'll make it so," he returned forcefully.</p>

<p>"I can't imagine&mdash;" she began slowly.</p>

<p>"You don't have to," he interrupted ar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>dently.
"Imagining is my business." He
beamed upon her with a smile that warmed her
through and through from the chill of the boat.
"If you haven't any other use for it just
now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, 'tain't any use," she said slowly.</p>

<p>"Then I may?" Phil embarrassed Miss
Foster terribly by seizing her hand.</p>

<p>Violet observed them from a window. "Is
Mr. Sidney proposing to Miss Foster?" she
laughed, turning to Eliza.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is, exactly," returned the latter,
hanging up her shade hat.</p>

<p>"Well, I can't imagine anyone refusing him,"
said Violet.</p>

<p>"I only hope she will," muttered Eliza; but
the devout words were scarcely out of her lips
when Phil came into the room like a cyclone
and she was seized and swung up till her
respectable head nearly grazed the ceiling.</p>

<p>"It's mine," he cried. "Hurray!" and went
out of the house again and across the field
toward the boulder cottage.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">THE NEW STUDIO</p>


<p>In spite of the incense Edgar had been receiving,
he was still a somewhat chastened being;
and he had no disagreeable remarks to make
about Phil when Mrs. Fabian wondered why he
stayed so long at the Wright cottage. He objected
to the fact somewhat on his own account.
No doubt Violet was entertaining Philip. She
had the artistic soul and Phil was horribly good-looking.
It was a soothing thought that he was
practically penniless and that he must soon
return to his labors in New York.</p>

<p>"How long are you expecting Phil to stay
here?" he asked his mother after a glance or
two across the empty field.</p>

<p>"He says only a week," replied Mrs. Fabian,
"but I hope to make it at least two. He's daft
about the island."</p>

<p>"But he couldn't work here," said Edgar
with conviction. "You've no place for oil and
turpentine and splotches generally."</p>

<p>"That's what he says," sighed Mrs. Fabian.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
"I told him this morning we'd give up the
summer-house to him."</p>

<p>Edgar faced her. "Where do I come in?" he
asked. "I expect the summer-house to save
your lives from me. I don't believe we can have
two artists in the family."</p>

<p>Kathleen caught the last words as she came
downstairs. "Don't worry," she said lightly.
"Phil will have none of us. He wants either a
ten-acre lot or a stable."</p>

<p>"Well, where is he?" asked Edgar, with some
irritation. "I'm as hungry as a hunter."</p>

<p>"And we have Aunt Mary's pretty things.
Eliza gave them to mother."</p>

<p>"You don't say so! Well, the Angel of Peace
has moulted a feather on this island. There, I
see Phil now, loping across the field. Do order
dinner to be served, mother."</p>

<p>The music-box was playing when the guest
entered.</p>

<p>"Oh, am I late?" he cried contritely, and
took the stairs in three bounds.</p>

<p>"How burned he is already!" laughed Mrs.
Fabian. "You will be looking like that in a few
days, Edgar."</p>

<p>The latter was standing, high-chested and
with repressed impatience, in an attitude his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
mother knew. He had not at all liked the radiance
of Phil's countenance as the latter burst
into the room.</p>

<p>"This dinner is especially ordered for you,
dear," said Mrs. Fabian soothingly, "from the
clam soup to the strawberry shortcake."</p>

<p>"When am I going to have any of it?" inquired
Edgar. "Is it worth while to be formal
here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he'll be down in one minute," said
Kathleen; and indeed Philip soon appeared and
they all seated themselves.</p>

<p>"Last offence, really," said the guest gaily,
"but one must be granted a little extra license
when he's proposing."</p>

<p>The waitress had placed the filled soup-plates
before the family sat down; and Edgar promptly
choked on his first mouthful. Violet had told
him of meeting Phil in Gramercy Park. Where
else and how often had the perfidious girl been
with him?</p>

<p>Kathleen swallowed her spoonful of soup, but
it was not hot enough to account for the strange
burning heat which suddenly travelled down her
spine.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian alone looked up. "Don't take
our breath away like that," she protested.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
"Who is the woman? Violet Manning or Eliza
Brewster?"</p>

<p>"I dreamed of her all last night," returned
Phil, eating hungrily. "I knew she was coming,
and I could hardly wait to learn my fate.
Didn't you notice that I merely played with
my breakfast this morning?"</p>

<p>"You ate like a hunter. Didn't he, Kathleen?"</p>

<p>Phil laughed and raised his happy eyes to his
hostess.</p>

<p>"Well, you'd save a whole lot of dinner this
noon, only that she said 'Yes.'"</p>

<p>There was a miniature storm of hurt vanity
in Edgar Fabian's breast. That was the way
with these "lookers." Let them have scarce the
price of a laundry bill, yet a girl couldn't resist
them; and that gaze of almost awed admiration
in Violet's eyes yesterday. It had meant nothing
then but a tribute to genius. Phil should
not have that look at his table daily! Edgar
wouldn't stand it. He would match his singing
against the other's painting, and time would
show if Philip Sidney would have a walk-away.
She couldn't be happy with a pauper like that,
and she should be saved.</p>

<p>As for Kathleen, she could not stop to criti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>cize
Philip's blunt announcement. Whether he
were jesting or in earnest his sudden words had
flashed an awful light upon her own sentiments.</p>

<p>"There's no depth to it," she thought now in
defence of her pain. "I know in time."</p>

<p>"Tell us more this minute," said Mrs. Fabian,
"and stop eating, you unromantic creature!
I didn't even suspect that you knew
Violet Manning well. You sly-boots. I'm offended
with you."</p>

<p>"The lovely Violet!" exclaimed Phil, "I left
her having an attack of emotional insanity over
there."</p>

<p>He looked up and met a gaze from Edgar,
suggestive of locking horns; and remembered
Gramercy Park, and Violet's sudden dignity.</p>

<p>"But not on my account," he went on easily.
"My inamorata's name is Jane!" He cast his
eyes adoringly ceilingward. "Dear little name!
Quaint little name! Jane!"</p>

<p>The relaxation that travelled throughout
Kathleen's limbs was as painful and as exasperating
as the burn had been. Her eyes were fixed
on her soup-plate, and she smiled.</p>

<p>Edgar's teeth shone with the utmost glee.
Phil wasn't such a bad sort after all. He regarded
him with interest, waiting for the sequel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span></p>

<p>"Philip Sidney, don't be idiotic," said Mrs.
Fabian. "My soup is getting cold waiting for
you to explain yourself."</p>

<p>"Why, Jane Foster came this morning, mother,"
said Kathleen. "I'll help you out."</p>

<p>"And I can really only stay with you a week,
Aunt Isabel," added Phil.</p>

<p>"She has taken you for a boarder? And all
this fuss is about that?" asked Mrs. Fabian.
"I should scarcely have thought you'd be so
crazy to change my house for hers."</p>

<p>"I know how Phil feels," said Edgar benevolently.
"He wants to feel free to make smudges."</p>

<p>"I do, Edgar, mind-reader that you are. Listen,
then, all of you. I proposed to Jane that she
let me use her chicken-house, and Jane, blessings
on her, said the one little word to make me
a happy man."</p>

<p>Phil's radiant gaze was bent now upon Kathleen,
who met it and nodded. "Just the
thing!" she said, and her mother and brother
started in on a Babel of tongues. Mrs. Fabian
had forgotten the chicken-house. She had not
been in that field for years; but Edgar approved,
and altogether they joined in Phil's jubilation,
and Mrs. Fabian related how she had prepared
Pat to pack for just such an exigency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span></p>

<p>"The little house is awfully dilapidated,"
said Kathleen. "Its piazza has fallen off; and
I'm sure it leaks. But perhaps you can make it
fit to hold your paraphernalia."</p>

<p>"Aunt Isabel, I want you and Kathleen to
keep away until I'm in order," said Phil impressively.
"You'd try to discourage me and
that would waste your time. Eliza is almost in
tears, but I know what I want and what I can
do."</p>

<p>"A chicken-house!" exclaimed Mrs. Fabian,
with second thoughts of disgust.</p>

<p>"Yes, nobody can come near but Edgar; and
if he does, he'll have to scrub."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much," and the young
man raised his eyebrows: "I have my own work
to do, you may remember." Scrubbing chicken-houses
he thought might even eclipse the
memory of lighting the oil-stove.</p>

<p>"Of course," returned Phil, all attention.
"I'm extremely interested in this determination
of yours. You certainly have the goods."</p>

<p>"So they tell me," said Edgar, and twisted
his mustache.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do for furniture?"
asked Mrs. Fabian. "You must at least have
some chairs and a table."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span></p>

<p>"And a lounge!" cried Phil,&mdash;"and an oil-stove."
He laughed toward Edgar. "I'm going
to live there, best of aunts, and maybe take my
dinners with Jane, the star of my existence!"</p>

<p>"Phil, you're crazy," said Mrs. Fabian, despairing.
"You will continue to live here and
work over there."</p>

<p>He shook his head gaily. "Don't worry. Just
watch; and if you have any attic treasures in the
way of furniture, let me store them for you."</p>

<p>When Mrs. Fabian really understood the enterprise
Phil was embarking upon, she resigned
herself, and finding an old suit of Mr. Fabian's
which he had used for fishing, she bestowed it
upon her guest.</p>

<p>Then the work commenced. Eliza tried with
a lofty sense of devotion to lend a hand and
even besought the privilege; but she was repulsed.
Philip induced Captain James to take
an interest in his scheme and render him assistance
at certain epochs in the reconstruction
period, but the Captain and Jane Foster were
the only persons privileged to come near the
scene of operations; and Miss Foster's heart so
far went out to her strong, determined young
tenant that she began hunting in her own garret
for things to help him along.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span></p>

<p>With shovel and wheelbarrow, scrubbing-brushes,
soapsuds, disinfectants, hammer and
nails, Phil went to work.</p>

<p>Eliza stood on her boundary-line, her hands
on her hips, and watched, her long nose lifted,
while loads of refuse and debris were patiently
wheeled down to the edge of the bank and given
over to the cleansing tide.</p>

<p>Violet generously offered her window which
gave upon the scene of operations, and the
opera-glass with which she watched birds; but
Eliza declined.</p>

<p>"I won't spy on him," she said, adding vindictively,
"but I'll look&mdash;the obstinate boy!"</p>

<p>The first time Kathleen called, Violet took
her up to her room and they sat in the open
window.</p>

<p>"The opera-glass is scarcely any use," she
explained, "for he hasn't washed the windows
yet and you can't see in at all."</p>

<p>Kathleen laughed, but shrank back. "I don't
want him to think we're watching," she replied.</p>

<p>"Oh, he knows we all are; but even after he
has gone at night, we don't dare to go and look
in. We can't pass that rock there&mdash;not even
Eliza."</p>

<p>A charming tenor voice suddenly sounded on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
the air, singing an aria from "La Bohme." The
girls looked and saw Edgar advancing toward
the chicken-house, peering in curiously.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Phil, attired in a sweater and Mr.
Fabian's trousers which scarcely reached his
ankles, dashed out at the caller and pressed a
scrubbing-brush on his acceptance. Edgar suddenly
stopped his lay and ran, laughing, toward
Mrs. Wright's, where he found the girls and
took them out on the water.</p>

<p>"I should think you'd want to help him,"
said Kathleen wistfully.</p>

<p>"I do," replied Edgar, "but I restrain myself.
Phil doesn't want me, really," he added;
and he was certainly right. Phil had no time to
stumble over Marcellines.</p>

<p>A week passed. Jane Foster had been smiling
and important for the last few days, but not
for kingdoms would Eliza have questioned her.
She had acquired an air of calm indifference,
which belied the burning curiosity within.
When Phil stopped in passing to speak with her,
she talked of the weather. Mrs. Wright, on the
contrary, expressed her eagerness to see what
was going on so near and yet so far from
them.</p>

<p>"Pluto gets ahead of us," she said, "and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
you've trained him so well he never tells anything."</p>

<p>Edgar happened to be present and he
shrugged his shoulders. "Better hurry up, Phil,"
he remarked, "and have your opening before
interest wanes. You'll have an anti-climax the
first thing you know."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wright turned the gentle radiance of
her eyes on the speaker.</p>

<p>"We heard you last night, singing as you
went home, Mr. Fabian," she said: "that
lovely voice floating across the field will make
us famous. People will hear it and wonder about
the source, and begin to talk of the angel of
Brewster's Island."</p>

<p>"Wonderfully level-headed people, those
Wrights," soliloquized Edgar, as he sauntered
home. "A distinct acquisition to the island."
Some thought occurred to him. "I wish father
could have heard that," he mused.</p>

<p>Phil lingered behind him. He had changed
into his own clothes remarkably early this afternoon.
There was an hour yet before supper-time.</p>

<p>"Where are the rest of your family this afternoon?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Violet went with Kathleen into the woods to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
get some specimens she wants for her microscope,"
replied Mrs. Wright.</p>

<p>"Where's Eliza?" Phil smiled as he asked it,
and his companion smiled in answer.</p>

<p>"In her room, I think."</p>

<p>Phil raised his eyebrows interrogatively.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so, a little," she replied softly,
nodding. "You see Jane has been there every
day."</p>

<p>"But that's all the rent I pay," protested
Phil, all very quietly, for though they were
standing outdoors, the windows were open.</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;it's a good deal for flesh and
blood to bear," said Mrs. Wright with a twinkling
glance. "The green-eyed monster ramps
at the best of us, you know."</p>

<p>"I wonder if I could see Eliza," said Phil in
his natural voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think she's in her room," returned
Mrs. Wright. "I'll go and see."</p>

<p>She disappeared, and Phil's eyes roved to
the boulder cottage and fixed there. A smile
touched the corners of his lips. He had not
meant to carry prohibition too far with Eliza.
It was genuine desire to save her trouble as well
as the wish to surprise her after her vehement
opposition to his scheme, which had made him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
warn her away. Now he was eager to make it
right with her.</p>

<p>"I remember now," said Mrs. Wright, returning;
"Eliza went down the hill this afternoon.
I don't know just when she'll come back;
but won't you sit down and wait for her?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, I don't believe I will. I'll come
back later. I've been a runaway guest all this
week," and with a smile of farewell, an eager
look grew in Phil's eyes as he started to run
across the field toward home.</p>

<p>In all his arrangements, each time he had
gained an effect he had thought of Kathleen's
amusement and appreciation.</p>

<p>As soon as he found that Eliza was out of the
question, his eagerness burst forth to get the
girls' point of view. He met Violet Manning
returning from the woods escorted by Edgar.</p>

<p>"I open the studio to-morrow," he cried
gaily. "Will you come to my tea at three-thirty?"</p>

<p>"Will we!" exclaimed Violet. "We couldn't
have lasted much longer! I'm glad you let us
see it 'before' so we can fully appreciate it
'after.'"</p>

<p>Violet was looking pretty and very happy.
Phil considered for one moment whether he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
should ask her to pour. Even yet he felt that
Kathleen lived in a remote rarefied air of elegance.
Would one dare ask her to dispense tea
in a chicken-house? But he wisely kept silence.
Aunt Isabel might yet enter into what she continued
to term his foolishness.</p>

<p>With a wave of his hand, he fled on his way,
and found Kathleen, flushed from her walk,
carrying mosses to the table in the wind-break.</p>

<p>"I've finished," he cried, vaulting over the
railing and appearing beside her. "Want to see
it?"</p>

<p>She looked up into his expectant eyes.</p>

<p>"Are we invited?" she returned.</p>

<p>"To-morrow, everybody is; but I thought
I'd like you to see it right now&mdash;if you aren't
too tired."</p>

<p>"A private view!" she exclaimed. "Who was
ever too tired for that? But I'm of the earth
so earthy, I shall have to go in and wash my
hands."</p>

<p>"No, no, don't," replied Phil softly. "You'd
meet Aunt Isabel, and this is to be clandestine.
Wipe your hands on this,"&mdash;he pulled
his handkerchief out of his pocket,&mdash;"and
come."</p>

<p>Kathleen laughed and brushing her fingers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
free of traces of the treasured moss, she wiped
them and they started across the field.</p>

<p>"Here's hoping Violet and Edgar don't see
us," said Phil, and took the path he had trodden
so often straight to the hen-house, and
which did not pass very near the Wrights.</p>

<p>As they approached, Kathleen looked curiously
at the little cottage with its sloping red
roof, nestling close to the ground on the breast
of the hill and sheltered by the tall Balm-of-Gilead
trees. Their rustling leaves held always
a murmur as of rain and to-day fleecy white
clouds piled against the blue sky behind the
cottage.</p>

<p>As they drew near, Kathleen stopped and
clasped her hands, and laughter bubbled from
her lips.</p>

<p>"That's clever!" she exclaimed heartily, and
Phil's eyes danced as she met them.</p>

<p>A swinging sign had been hung above the low
door. Upon it strutted a splendid cock and
above his proudly lifted comb appeared the
legend:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Villa Chantecler.</span>
</p>

<p>Phil threw open the low door with a sweeping
bow; and Kathleen paused on the threshold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
with a low cry of surprise; then stepped into the
cool, dusky interior.</p>

<p>She found herself in a low-ceiled room with
small-paned windows set high. A golden radiance
streamed through, falling on the soft tone
of floor and walls.</p>

<p>On a table draped with dull green a tall
candlestick and ivory-tinted plate reflected
gleams of light.</p>

<p>Kathleen sank on the cushions of a long, low
divan.</p>

<p>"You can paint Rembrandt portraits in
here!" she said. "Don't explain how you've
done it. I don't want to know. It is the most
restful, delightful studio I've ever seen&mdash;and
smelling of ambergris?"</p>

<p>"No, only of bay leaves."</p>

<p>Phil waited and let her look at the hangings,
the cushioned chairs, and spindle legs of the
quaint table.</p>

<p>"You like it," he said after a pause of deep
satisfaction.</p>

<p>She looked up at him. "I am making genuflexions
to you in my mind."</p>

<p>He laughed. "But the best is yet to come. Sit
where you are."</p>

<p>He moved to the back of the room and opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
a door toward the ocean. It was as if a brilliant
panel had suddenly been set in the dark wall.</p>

<p>Kathleen sprang to her feet.</p>

<p>"Like enamel!" she said softly, and approached
the opening.</p>

<p>It led upon a terrace with a white railing.
Tall white pillars at either end were crowned
with dark-green bay.</p>

<p>"Is it a stage-setting," she said, "or is it
practicable?"</p>

<p>"Come out and see."</p>

<p>Together they moved outside and the wind
came up out of the sea across the sleeping field
and swept their faces and set the young leaves
of the orchard to whispering with sweet fresh
lips to their gnarled stems.</p>

<p>Kathleen looked up at her companion, smiled
and shook her head.</p>

<p>"You have added poetry to our island," she
said. "I didn't think any one could do that."</p>

<p>Phil met her gaze.</p>

<p>"And you," he said, "have put the finishing
touch to my satisfaction."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">PHILIP'S LETTER</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Mother</span>:&mdash;You remember I told
you I had found a pig's ear and was going to
make a silk purse out of it despite the scepticism
of the neighborhood. Behold the purse! I
call it the Villa Chantecler. It has taken me
the whole week, but the result&mdash;well, Kathleen
says I have added poetry to the island, and
I suspect she is authority on poetry, although
that too is hidden in one of the locked rooms
I've told you about. She gives just enough of
herself to each person to fit every occasion; but
the way she took the first view of the Villa yesterday
was like everything else she does; perfection.
I didn't know I was going to write that.
I didn't know I thought it. That's the beauty
of having some one to whom you can think
aloud. You find out what you do think; but she
and I touch only on the high places and when
we leave the island we shall fly apart for the
whole winter again; with pleasant memories,
however. She has a positive talent for letting
people alone. I love such people!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, to tell you how I did my little trick.
I could never have done it but for New England
tenacity and thrift. They never throw
anything away in this part of the world; and
even importations like Aunt Isabel collect
some lumber-room outcasts rather than injure
the scenery by throwing them over the
bank.</p>

<p>Jane Foster, adorable landlady and Lady
Bountiful that she is, turned me loose in her
attic, and told me to help myself. So, first of all,
I made the hen-house shine with cleanliness.
Then Cap'n James helped me drag up its dejected
piazza which had capsized in the neighboring
field. We nailed it to the house and
painted it white.</p>

<p>Aunt Isabel had discarded a Crex rug, which
I took for my studio, also a three-legged divan
and chairs whose cane seats had surrendered.
These I mended and cushioned. In Miss Foster's
attic, I found what I should think were all
the potato sacks that had ever been used in the
Foster family. These made my hangings and
cushions, although the poverty they implied
nearly reduced Jane to tears. She implored me
to use turkey red and found enough in the attic
to begin on. The stuff smelled so new, I'm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
nearly certain the dear woman bought it and
placed it there.</p>

<p>I found an old spinet under the eaves. Its
voice had long departed; but its charming legs
and framework were intact. I placed some
boards across that and used my green bathrobe
for a cover. I took a straight length of pipe,
fixed it into a wooden stand, topped it with a
spool, bronzed the whole thing, and behold, a
stunning candlestick in which stands a tall wax
candle.</p>

<p>Among the refuse I had carried out of the
place, I had found charming old plates, heavy as
lead, crackled with age, and cream and gray in
color. These I disposed variously, and I am perfectly
sure Cap'n James and Jane Foster have
laid their heads together in order to condole
over the fact that so pleasant a young man
should have so gloomy and unpicturesque a
taste when he expects to get his living by that
same lame faculty. In fact, Cap'n James unburdened
his mind one day. He said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ain't you goin' to have anything cheerful
'round here? It looks to me more fit for hens
than it does for folks right now."</p>

<p>Under the house I found lengths of drain-pipe.
These I used on my terrace at the back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
of the Villa, overlooking the sea. When I had
placed these pillars at each end of the railing
and crowned them with the polished bay that
grows luxuriantly here, I had a quite Italian
effect, I assure you.</p>

<p>Jane looks at me with pitiful eyes, and yesterday
came down to the Villa with a framed
chromo from her parlor wall.</p>

<p>"I just as lieves you'd use it as not," she
said, "and anyway you might put it up till the
folks have seen the place. Your own paintin's
can go up later." I almost kissed her, she pitied
me so, and I could see that she agreed with
Cap'n James, who said the place gave him the
"Injun blues."</p>

<p>There is a rough stairway that leads to the
half-floored room above. I took a drain-pipe to
make a newel post for that. It is surmounted
with a bronze Mercury on a pedestal. The
pedestal is a small, rusty tin wash-basin that I
found under the house. I covered it with varnish
and rolled it in sand, inverted it, and behold!
I also gave an appearance of advanced
age to the Mercury; so the general appearance
is as of a treasure from Pompeii.</p>

<p>If only you and father could see and feel the
beauty and the heavenly quiet of the place. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
have a kitchen, too. The door was a wreck, and
I tacked upon it a dark ornate window shade
which tones in with all the rest.</p>

<p>Sometimes I feel as if I were only living to see
you again. I know it's what I'm working for
anyway; and I well know that you are working
for me every day of your dear life.</p>

<p>I love you.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">PHILIP ENTERTAINS</p>


<p>Philip still had Eliza on his mind, so when
Kathleen had left him, he went back to the
farmhouse and had the good fortune to meet
Eliza returning home.</p>

<p>"I'm looking for you!" he called cheerfully.</p>

<p>She regarded him unsmiling. "Well," she remarked
carelessly, "you look like a gentleman
of leisure."</p>

<p>"Just what I am. You guessed right. My
Villa is finished and I've been waiting for you
because I'm going to let everybody in to-morrow
and I wanted you to see it with me alone."</p>

<p>"My opinion ain't worth anything," said
Eliza; "besides, it's pretty near time to get
supper. Miss Foster went up to Portland to-day."</p>

<p>"I know she did. That's why I'm in a hurry
to take you into the studio before the boat arrives.
You know how discouraging you were,
Eliza, and I wanted to surprise you. I'd have
liked to surprise everybody, but, of course, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
hadn't the nerve to keep Miss Foster out. The
rent I pay didn't warrant it." The speaker
twinkled down into Eliza's unresponsive eyes.
"I'm going to give a tea to-morrow and I want
to talk it over with you."</p>

<p>They had strolled near to the rustic bench
where Mrs. Wright was still sitting with her
work.</p>

<p>"Eliza is going with me to have a private
view of the Villa," said Phil. "Your turn to-morrow.
I'm going to give a tea. Will you
come?"</p>

<p>"Most assuredly," answered Mrs. Wright.
"As soon as you cleaned those windows, my
curiosity began to effervesce."</p>

<p>"I can't go now," said Eliza. "I've waited
this long, I guess I can wait till to-morrow. I've
got to get supper."</p>

<p>Philip threw an arm around her and drew her
forward.</p>

<p>"Boarders have come, Mr. Philip," she exclaimed.
"They'll see you."</p>

<p>"I hope they will," he responded firmly. "If
they don't know I love you, it's the best way to
tell them."</p>

<p>Eliza walked along stiffly, perforce, toward
the forbidden ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I thought I'd make a grand splurge to-morrow,
and give a tea," he continued. "I
want you to preside."</p>

<p>"Do what?"</p>

<p>"Pour. I want you to pour for me."</p>

<p>"H'm. Ridiculous! Let one of the girls do it."</p>

<p>"Well, just as you say. Now, then," they
were drawing near the little house, "prepare!
Be a good sport now, and own yourself wrong if
you think you are. See my shingle?"</p>

<p>Eliza's eyes followed his gesture and caught
sight of the crowing cock.</p>

<p>"H'm," she said; then they went inside.</p>

<p>Eliza looked about in silence for a minute.</p>

<p>"It's clean," she said at last; and Phil knew
she was moved to catch at a word of praise as
one says of a neighbor's plain and uninteresting
baby, "How healthy he looks!"</p>

<p>He began explaining his devices to Eliza and
her heart was touched by his joy in all this
cheap gloom.</p>

<p>By the time he opened the back door, she was
ready to weep over him; and she said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That's a real sightly piazza."</p>

<p>Then they moved into the little kitchen.</p>

<p>"I've been waiting for you to tell me what to
do here," said the artist, and Eliza rose to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
bait and began pulling things about and showing
him where shelves must be placed.</p>

<p>"How are you goin' to give a tea," she asked,
"with one broken mug?"</p>

<p>"Borrow cups and saucers from Aunt Isabel.
That's easy; but," he looked down at Eliza,
whose face had regained its usual alertness, "it
occurred to me that perhaps I have some of my
own&mdash;those that you packed for me and that
ran away to the island."</p>

<p>"Mr. Philip, I'm a fool to forget those!" responded
the other, after gazing at him in silence.
"You shall have every one of 'em. They're all
mixed in with the Foster things. I'll pick 'em
out; and we'll lend you all you need beside."</p>

<p>"Would it interfere with supper proceedings
if we were to do it right now?"</p>

<p>"Law! it ain't time to get supper yet," responded
Eliza, so promptly that, as they hurried
out of the door, Phil stooped to break a long
blade of grass to bite.</p>

<p>A vigorous search was at once instituted for
the china, and Phil and Eliza carried it down to
the studio; and as they went, Mr. Wright came
up from the water and joined his wife.</p>

<p>"We're to be let in to-morrow," she said.
"He has finished."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, it's been a job," remarked Mr.
Wright, who had occasionally sat on a log and
watched Phil at his roof-mending or some other
strenuous part of the work.</p>

<p>"Yes, he ought to succeed," said Mrs.
Wright. "He hasn't a lazy bone in his body."</p>

<p>"There aren't many of us that have at his
age," remarked Mr. Wright. "Are there,
Pluto?"</p>

<p>The cat had run to meet him like a dog.
For him the scent of Mr. Wright's fishing trousers
was as the perfume of Araby; and he followed
him to the room in the shed where his
friend changed them for habiliments more generally
agreeable.</p>

<p>At last Phil returned to the boulder cottage
where he found Mrs. Fabian and Kathleen in
the wind-break. The latter was working at the
table, sorting the moss specimens for her slides.</p>

<p>She looked up at him now with a new realization
of his powers.</p>

<p>"Well, you said this morning to-day would
finish the work," said Mrs. Fabian, closing her
novel on her finger for a mark. "Are you
through?"</p>

<p>"As nearly as I ever shall be," he replied,
throwing himself into a chair near Kathleen's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
table and regarding her deft fingers at their
work.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad," said Mrs. Fabian, "for
we've seen nothing of you. I like the way you
visit us."</p>

<p>He looked at her quickly to see if there were
feeling behind the accusation.</p>

<p>"Now, you'll have to stay on a week when
you are not so preoccupied."</p>

<p>"Not if he doesn't wish to, mother," said
Kathleen, going on with her work. Her cheeks
were still flushed from the warm tramp to the
woods; the red glints in her hair shone lustrous.</p>

<p>"It does look like making use of you, doesn't
it?" he said impetuously. "But you're so good
to me, both of you. To-morrow you'll forgive
me, Aunt Isabel, when you see I have a place to
work and trouble no one. I do hope it won't
rain."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Kathleen, handling a tiny bit
of moss. "The moon holds the weather."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian laughed. "Kathleen, the astronomer,"
she said.</p>

<p>The girl nodded. "It may not be a scientific
way to put it, but I've always noticed it here.
It will be full to-morrow night. The weather
won't change till the moon does."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span></p>

<p>"Delightfully consoling," said Phil, continuing
to watch her averted face. It seemed to him
this was the first time since Christmas night
that his mind had been sufficiently at leisure
from itself to concentrate upon her. He suddenly
remembered that she used to like cigarettes.
He had not yet seen her use one. Perhaps
she was aiding Edgar in the stern limit which he
was imposing upon himself.</p>

<p>"I wonder," he said, "if either of you would
pour for me at my grand tea to-morrow."</p>

<p>Kathleen did not look up, but her cheeks
grew warmer while she manipulated the moss.</p>

<p>"Oh, a tea in the chicken-house," laughed
Mrs. Fabian.</p>

<p>The light jeering tone struck Kathleen as
coming at a particularly unfortunate moment.</p>

<p>"I will. Be glad to," she said heartily.</p>

<p>"Whom are you going to invite? The fish?"
laughed Mrs. Fabian.</p>

<p>Phil's navet was dashed by her tone. Kathleen
felt it.</p>

<p>"Mother's jealous, Phil," she said, "because
she has seen so little of you all the week. She is at
fever heat of curiosity as to what you have been
doing; and as for tea! Mother's an inebriate.
She won't leave any for the fish. You'll see."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span></p>

<p>Phil looked at the speaker gratefully, and
leaned toward her a little. "I have the right
barrel at last," he said. "The one that ran
away to the island. Do you remember?"</p>

<p>His eyes were so very speaking that Kathleen
dropped hers to the moss. She nodded and
smiled.</p>

<p>"It knew where it ought to go, didn't it?"
she returned.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian's countenance had sobered. She
knew the descendant of the Van Ruyslers so
well that she understood that she had offended.</p>

<p>"Can't one make a bit of fun once in a
while?" she asked in injured tones of Kathleen
when next they were alone.</p>

<p>"Yes, once in a while," answered the girl,
and kissed her.</p>

<p>"It'll be something funny for you to look
back upon when you come out, Kathleen, that
your first function after graduating took place
in a chicken-house."</p>

<p>"I hope I shall not be homesick for it,"
thought the girl; but she only smiled.</p>

<p>"Kathleen is certainly touchy about Phil,"
mused Mrs. Fabian. "She glared up at me just
the way she did last fall when I wanted to get
Aunt Mary's silver. She is the queerest girl!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span></p>

<p>The moon or something else did hold the
weather and the artist could have had no better
day on which to give his proof that where
there's a will there's a way.</p>

<p>The company swarmed through the little
house, laughing, admiring, questioning. At last
they stood on the terrace.</p>

<p>"My dear boy!" exclaimed Mrs. Wright.
"You could have no better view if you were a
millionaire!"</p>

<p>"The only thing lacking," cried Violet, "is a
white peacock. Where is the white peacock?"</p>

<p>"How about it, Edgar?" asked Phil.
"Couldn't you stand out there for the lady?"</p>

<p>"The nightingale could never deceive us,"
said Mrs. Wright, bending her universally loving
gaze on Edgar, whose chin was held rather
higher than usual.</p>

<p>"That's so," cried Phil. "Sing us something,
Edgar, right here and now."</p>

<p>"Certainly," responded the gifted one, regarding
his host as he launched easily into song:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">"'I'm looking for a lobster and I think you'll do.'"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Mrs. Fabian did not join in the laugh. She
had moved inside, and her lorgnette was fixed
on a closed door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span></p>

<p>"I must see in there, Phil," she said.</p>

<p>"Of course, you must, Mrs. Bluebeard," he
replied. "You may all go in this once, but it's
the last time ever, I warn you, for that is my
kitchen."</p>

<p>They swarmed through to the little room,
where Edgar perceived with a groan an oil-stove
burning cosily in the midst of canvas, paints,
easel, et cetera.</p>

<p>"<em>I'll</em> never go in again, I promise you," he
declared.</p>

<p>At the host's invitation, the company arranged
themselves on the rejuvenated chairs
and couch, and Kathleen made tea at the
spindle-legged table.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian's lorgnette was bent upon the
newel post.</p>

<p>"However did you make him stand up,
dear?" she asked, regarding the Mercury which
had winged his way from her garret. "We
haven't been upstairs yet, remember."</p>

<p>"And you won't go till you're tired of life,"
returned the host. "It abounds in trapdoors
and, aside from my affection for you, the furniture
down here couldn't stand being fallen on."</p>

<p>Being turned ceilingward, Mrs. Fabian's
lorgnette discovered that branches of bay had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
been woven through the rafters in some places.
She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"You'll get rained on in this dilapidated old
place," she said. "A few bay leaves can't
deceive me."</p>

<p>"Madam! Are you aware that you are talking
about the Villa Chantecler? That roof is as
tight as a drum."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian stirred the lemon in her substantially
thick cup; and looked admiringly at
the energetic host.</p>

<p>"I only hope, Phil," she sighed, "that you
aren't too practical to succeed in your profession.
So few artists would know how to mend a
roof or even remember the necessity for it. I
hope it isn't a bad sign."</p>

<p>Edgar, sitting with Violet on the railing,
drinking tea, heard his mother's comment.</p>

<p>"A good deal in that, I think," he remarked
softly. "I've never seen any of Phil's things
except that rough black-and-white stuff he has
in there. He never seemed to me to have a particle
of temperament."</p>

<p>Violet was inclined to agree. She had seen
nothing amusing in Philip's chaff about the
peacock. She thought it quite as silly as were
the other comments on the robin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish you would sing something," she said.
"Do, and surprise them."</p>

<p>"I can't. I haven't even a banjo."</p>

<p>"I've noticed you have everything over at
the house: banjo, guitar, mandolin, everything.
You must leave one of them over here. Music
would sound perfectly charming in this place."</p>

<p>"<em>Any</em> music?" asked Edgar, smiling.</p>

<p>She returned his look from the tops of her
eyes. "Bold fisherman," she replied.</p>

<p>Her companion scanned the horizon: "The
moon is going to be great to-night. It looks as
if it would rise clear out of the water. Want to
go for a sail?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe I can," replied Violet. "I
have an engagement."</p>

<p>"An engagement!" returned Edgar, sceptically.
"Are you going to read aloud to your
aunt?"</p>

<p>Violet smiled at him provokingly. "You're
not the only man on this island," she remarked.</p>

<p>A quick flush mounted to Edgar's forehead.</p>

<p>"Phil?" he asked quickly.</p>

<p>She nodded, mutely, and took the last swallow
of her tea.</p>

<p>Her companion looked as if he might be in the
throes of the red mood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's beastly," he said, dismayed to think
that in all Phil's preoccupation he had had sufficient
forethought to secure Violet for this
perfect evening. "Since when?" he demanded
fiercely.</p>

<p>"Since yesterday," she returned demurely,
apparently unconscious that the arrangement
caused annoyance.</p>

<p>"Very well, then, we'll take the yacht," he
said, "and let the crowd go. Phil can help me
sail her. I was intending to take the motor-boat
and you alone."</p>

<p>"I don't know whether Mr. Sidney would
care to," she returned coolly, "but it's very
kind of you."</p>

<p>Edgar regarded her, baffled. "What&mdash;what
had you planned to do?" he asked. He knew
the question was inexcusable and braced himself
for a snub; but the sweet Violet, exultant at
his open disturbance, administered none.</p>

<p>"Nothing special," she replied. "Mr. Sidney
is invited to dine with us, in celebration of the
completion of the improvements he has been
making on the estate. That's all."</p>

<p>"Oh, absurd!" declared Edgar. "As if you
couldn't dine any foggy night. Well, you don't
need to stay after dinner. He isn't your guest."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span></p>

<p>Violet regarded him with an ironical smile.</p>

<p>"I've been taught manners," she said. "Beside,
perhaps I want to stay. Didn't that
occur to you?"</p>

<p>Edgar scowled and looked off on the ocean
and back again. "I don't want to take the
whole family out in order to get you," he said,
fuming.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't," she answered, laughing. "It
isn't worth the trouble."</p>

<p>Her companion clenched his even teeth. He
didn't want to risk Philip's meandering about
the island alone with Violet on such an evening
as this was going to be. He would be sure to talk
of his work and his hopes, and her confoundedly
soulful eyes would look back at him comprehendingly,
and a precedent would be established
and&mdash;</p>

<p>"You see, Mr. Sidney expects to take all his
dinners with us after he begins working here,"
went on Violet sweetly. "It will be so convenient
just to run across."</p>

<p>Edgar gave her a furious glance, but the simplicity
of her regard was complete.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wright came to the open door. "We're
going now, Violet," she said. "Will you come?
Our host positively refuses to allow us to help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
him put things away, and he will follow a little
later. I've been hoping," turning to Edgar,
"that you might be moved to sing as you sat out
here."</p>

<p>The young man had sprung to his feet and
was trying to banish evidences of the red mood
from his brow.</p>

<p>"I wanted to take Violet out on the water to-night,"
he said. "It seems there's an obstacle."</p>

<p>"Yes, a large one," returned Mrs. Wright
pleasantly. "Lots of evenings coming, but I
don't know about letting my little girl go on the
water at night."</p>

<p>"I guarantee her safety. I've come here ever
since I was a baby, Mrs. Wright, and I'm an
amphibious animal; but if Sidney should ever
suggest it, remember he's a landlubber. Half
the time they don't know enough to be afraid."</p>

<p>"Very true," returned Mrs. Wright, with her
natural graceful sweetness of manner, which
at least succeeded in making Edgar feel rude.
"Come, dear," turning to Violet, "I'd like to
have you come with me."</p>

<p>So the girl rose and yielded her cup to Edgar,
who took it with dignity. He, the ex-cavalier of
Mrs. Larrabee, not to be able to mould circumstances
among these poor and provincial people!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span></p>

<p>He took leave of Philip, and tendered his
congratulations with an air fitted to grace marble
halls. "I believe," he added, "you don't
dine at home to-night."</p>

<p>"No," replied Phil, "Miss Foster is very
kindly entertaining her tenant."</p>

<p>Edgar pricked up his ears; and instantly ran
after Violet. "Phil says Jane Foster invited him,"
he said vehemently. "I shall call for you by eight
o'clock. I'll take the best care of her, Mrs.
Wright. I assure you I will, and bring her in
early."</p>

<p>He was off before he could be gainsaid, and
Mrs. Wright noticed that Violet's expression
was such as might be worn by a well-grown kitten
who had been hilariously entertained in a
game with a mouse which was as yet unfinished
and highly promising.</p>

<p>The events of the week had thrown light on
the happiness Violet evinced the day of her
arrival under Edgar Fabian's escort. Mrs.
Wright's tenderness for her orphan niece was
alertly watchful. She put an arm around her
now and drew her away from the house, and
they walked slowly across the grass.</p>

<p>"It really is perfectly safe to go on the water
with Edgar," said the girl, half laughing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span></p>

<p>"For me, it might be," returned Mrs. Wright
quietly.</p>

<p>Violet blushed deeply, and dreaded what
might be coming.</p>

<p>"The Fabians are nice people," went on her
aunt, "very rich people and able to give you
pleasures, and I like you to be friendly with
them; but I'm a little afraid of this situation."</p>

<p>"You needn't be," burst forth the girl impulsively.
"Edgar doesn't really care much
about me."</p>

<p>"That's the trouble," said Mrs. Wright
quietly.</p>

<p>The reply was so unexpected that Violet felt
a sharp twinge of mortification and a spontaneous
desire to show her aunt that she was
wrong. There were lots of small proofs that she
might give her&mdash;</p>

<p>"No," she returned, suddenly serious. "He
cares very much for me in a certain way: my
understanding of his gift&mdash;and his hopes&mdash;and
his career. His family mean to be kind, but
they're so unsympathetic. They're not temperamental
like him and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Violet paused because Aunt Amy was smiling.
It was unkind to smile at such a time. Very
well! Her lips should be sealed from this time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
on. She would never again speak to her about
Edgar!</p>

<p>"He is very attractive even with all his conceit,"
said Mrs. Wright, who was quite conscious
that the girl's slender body had suddenly
a resentful rigidity. "A beautiful tenor voice
and conceit seem to be inseparable in this mundane
sphere; and if my little girl has understood
and responded to his outpourings about himself
she is charming to him." Mrs. Wright paused
and then went on: "Look around, Violet, and
realize that you are the only girl here to whom
he can show attention. Did he show you any in
New York? Did he go out of his way for you?
You fell right into his reach on the train and he
took the gifts the gods provided; and they were
very sweet gifts."</p>

<p>The speaker squeezed her unresponsive listener,
whose heart was beating hotly. "As a
rule men are marauders," she went on. "As a
rule, women are single-hearted, faithful. There
are exceptions. I want to give you one piece of
advice and I can't put it too strongly. Take it
in and act upon it, and it may save you a world
of hurt vanity, and possibly a broken heart. No
matter how a man behaves toward you,&mdash;no
matter how he looks, or what he does,&mdash;or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
what he says,&mdash;don't believe or even imagine
that he loves you until he tells you he does, in
so many words."</p>

<p>There were tears in the baby-bachelor's blue
eyes. Among the stormy emotions that filled
her was the horrible suspicion that, instead of
being a foreordained victor, the kitten might
possibly in the end be the mouse's victim.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Sidney," went on Mrs. Wright's
calm voice, "is a man who I believe has hold of
life by the right end."</p>

<p>"He is always making fun of Edgar," burst
forth Violet, her breath coming fast. "You
heard what he said about the peacock."</p>

<p>At this, Mrs. Wright fell a peg lower in her
niece's estimation, for she laughed.</p>

<p>"I knew what he meant," she answered, "but
I couldn't let the lovely singer's feelings be
hurt."</p>

<p>"Knew what he meant!" exclaimed Violet,
indignantly, and suddenly breaking away from
her aunt's embrace, she ran toward the house
and disappeared.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wright followed the fleeing form with
her eyes, and nodded gently.</p>

<p>"I thought so. Only just in time," she said to
herself. The seed was dropped, and even though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
the ground did have to be harrowed to get the
necessary depth, it was better so.</p>

<p>The evening was as beautiful as Edgar
Fabian had foreseen. One of the many charms
of Brewster's Island was the habit the wind
had of lulling at sunset, often making the
evening air milder than that of day.</p>

<p>To-night the sun had sunk in a clear sky behind
the White Mountains. All the family at
the Wright cottage had come out after supper
to see the Presidential Range, ninety miles
away, silhouetted black against the golden
glory.</p>

<p>"One can breathe here," thought Philip.
"One can breathe here." He wondered if
Kathleen were watching the sunset.</p>

<p>"Oh, but turn around," cried Violet suddenly.
"This is a three-ringed circus. One
should live on a pivot here on a clear night."</p>

<p>Phil turned obediently, and saw the waters
dashing against a huge disk of pale gold.</p>

<p>Kathleen, lying in her hammock, arm folded
beneath her head, was also watching the moon.</p>

<p>Edgar sat near her on the steps, smoking his
third cigarette that day. It was his rigid allowance.
He saw dimly the figures come out from
the Wright cottage and his first impulse was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
stroll across and join them; but pride forbade.
Supposing he were to get there just in time to see
Violet walk off with Philip.</p>

<p>"What a perfect evening!" said Kathleen
lazily. "Go in and get the guitar, Edgar, and
sing me something."</p>

<p>Sing something! Edgar's teeth clenched at
the thought.</p>

<p>"I've practised such a lot to-day, I'm no
good," he replied.</p>

<p>"Why, I didn't hear you," she said.</p>

<p>"No. I took my trusty pitch-pipe down in
the woods and scared the birds. I have some
mercy on you and mother."</p>

<p>"What is your aim?" asked his sister. "What
do you want to do? Concert work?"</p>

<p>"Yes, perhaps. Mazzini says I could teach
right now if I wanted to."</p>

<p>"Teach?" repeated Kathleen, trying to speak
respectfully, but smiling at the man in the
moon, who grinned back as if he understood.</p>

<p>"Of course, there's no necessity for that, so I
shall simply prepare myself for public work;
recitals; possibly go abroad for the prestige of
study over there. Not that I need it but the
name goes a long way, and if I should go into
opera it is best to begin there."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span></p>

<p>The man in the moon grew redder in the face.
So did Kathleen; but she knew that sublime
self-assurance is an asset not to be despised.
She looked at her brother's trim shapely head,
rising from the white silk collar of his neglige
shirt.</p>

<p>"Does Mazzini really think you are already
prepared to teach?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. I had very few errors in method to
unlearn, and he says, given a good voice, a good
presence, and good looks, tact, and an attractive
studio, pupils will come fast enough," replied
Edgar carelessly. "He said he'd send me
his overflow; but of course all that was in joke.
He knows that it is no question of money with
me."</p>

<p>Kathleen ceased to smile at the moon, for her
thoughts recurred to their father, meeting his
problems in the heat of the great city. So far
his letters had breathed no hint of trouble.</p>

<p>"That's a glorious feeling, Edgar," she said
soberly, "to feel certain that you can be independent."</p>

<p>"Yes," he returned, speaking low, and holding
the cigarette between his fingers. "I said I'd
show father, and I will."</p>

<p>The remainder of his thoughts he did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
voice; but there was some one else he meant to
show. The vivacious Mrs. Larrabee who had
dared to use him when it suited her and then
discard him with raised eyebrows and a scornful
word. She should see him win the plaudits
of the multitude; then, when she endeavored to
add her incense and claim to have been his inspiration,
it should be his turn to show cold
disdain. He ground the even teeth at some
memory.</p>

<p>"I want to tell you, Edgar," went on Kathleen
in the same serious tone, "that I am proud
of your determination; proud of your regular
work; proud of your cutting down on smoking;
and it will overwhelm me with joy to see you
succeed."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Kath," he returned. "I appreciate
that."</p>

<p>"And I also want to ask you not to make
love to Violet Manning," went on the low, serious
voice.</p>

<p>Edgar was dumb, and now the man in the
moon met <em>him</em> with a grin.</p>

<p>"You know it will be only an idle pastime
with you, and because she is the only girl here.
It might mean a lot to her, and&mdash;it's a hard
world for girls."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span></p>

<p>Kathleen had not intended to end her appeal
in that way, but the declaration broke from her.</p>

<p>"She doesn't care a picayune for me," returned
Edgar. "Don't you worry." He hoped
his sister would contradict him; but she did not.</p>

<p>"You might be able to make her," she said.
"Be too manly to try, Edgar. Do, do be unselfish
and honest."</p>

<p>The earnest deliberation of her tone caused
her listener to reflect for a moment; and the
man in the moon, by this time crimson in the
face, met his frowning regard mirthfully.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">BY MOONLIGHT</p>


<p>While Edgar was still frowning, and divided
between consoled pride and a consciousness of
guilt, a tall dark form came into sight in the
moonlit landscape. It broke into a run as it
neared the cottage, and with a sense of relief
Edgar recognized Philip Sidney, who bounded
over the piazza railing.</p>

<p>Catching sight of Edgar sitting alone, he
spoke eagerly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Has Kathleen gone anywhere?"</p>

<p>"No, she's there in the hammock. How did
you break away so early?"</p>

<p>"I didn't think it was going to be easy," replied
Phil half laughing, and looking toward the
shadowy hammock where Kathleen in her white
gown was watching him; "but we finished supper
a long time ago, and&mdash;and have been talking
ever since. We had told each other about
everything we knew, and so I thought"&mdash;his
voice trailed away&mdash;"well, I think I was
homesick."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why didn't you bring Violet with you?"
asked Edgar.</p>

<p>"I tried to; that is, I suggested that it was
too heavenly a night to keep still, and asked her
if she would like to go to walk&mdash;" As he talked,
Phil kept his eyes on the white figure in the hammock
and he spoke eagerly as if he were justifying
himself. "But," he went on, "she said she
had a headache and felt that she must excuse
herself."</p>

<p>Edgar looked up triumphantly at the man in
the moon, but he refused to see the joke. His
hilarious mood had changed. He beamed down
now in pensive golden serenity with the usual
remote benevolence for all lovers which has won
his reputation.</p>

<p>"What was there in that tea I made?" inquired
Kathleen lazily. "Mother has the headache,
too. Isn't it a shame on such an evening."</p>

<p>"Too bad," said Phil perfunctorily. He approached
the hammock and neither he nor
Kathleen noted that Edgar made an unostentatious
departure such as the comic papers describe
as a cat-like sneak. Certainly Pluto
could not have moved any more quietly, and his
heart was gay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span></p>

<p>"Headache!" he thought, the even teeth
broadly exhibited. "What that headache needs
is the water-cure"; and the boarders sitting out
in front of the Wright cottage heard the
"Toreador Song" blithely whistled by some
one coming across the field.</p>

<p>When Edgar arrived at the farmhouse he
looked about for a familiar figure. Among the
little group, Eliza Brewster was the only one he
knew. He approached her with his most
debonair manner.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Eliza. Will you please tell
Miss Manning I am here?"</p>

<p>"She's got the headache, Mr. Fabian."</p>

<p>"So Mr. Sidney said; but I thought she
might see me for just a minute. I want to tell
her something important."</p>

<p>"Well, that's too bad, 'cause she's gone to
bed. I'll take any message you want me to,
and give it to her in the morning. I'd rather
not disturb her now 'cause I just took her up a
pitcher o' water and she told me she was goin'
to try to go to sleep."</p>

<p>Edgar was so blankly silent that Eliza spoke
again.</p>

<p>"I'll call Mrs. Wright if you'd rather see her.
She's in her room writin' a letter."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, no, don't trouble yourself," said the
visitor, lightly. "Good night."</p>

<p>He moved away quickly toward the Villa
Chantecler and made a dtour around it. The
little piazza overlooking the sea gleamed white
in the moonlight. The bay leaves stood up
crisp and polished. Edgar recalled the mocking
in Violet's eyes as they had sat there this afternoon.
To lose an evening like this. It was a
crime!</p>

<p>Coming out beside the orchard he looked up
at the windows of Violet's room. They were
dark.</p>

<p>His hopeful vanity relinquished the hope that
she had man&oelig;uvred to get rid of Phil in order
to leave the coast clear for himself. He moved
up the incline and threw himself down in the
shadow. He could hear a stir at the front of
the house. The lingerers in the moonlight were
moving inside and he could see lamps twinkle in
rooms where the shades were pulled down.</p>

<p>In a few minutes more all lights vanished.
Only the rising tide broke the stillness. Edgar
had been giving himself over to dreams of a
brilliant future in which his only handicap consisted
of his father's money. Would the cynical
blas critics be able to be as fair to him as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
he had been discovered among the peasants of
Italy?</p>

<p>Suddenly he realized that never would a
more wonderful stage-setting be his than that
which now surrounded him. He rose on his
elbow and looked up again at Violet's windows.</p>

<p>Then he began to sing. Into the girl's unrestful
dreams the sound fell like balm:&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">"Drink to me only with thine eyes,</div>
    <div class="verse">And I will pledge with mine."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>She was wide awake suddenly and looking
wide-eyed toward the open windows.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">"Leave but a kiss within the cup</div>
    <div class="verse">And I'll not ask for wine."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Her heart beat fast and she pressed her hand
over her eyes, every faculty absorbed in listening
to the melting loveliness of the voice.</p>

<p>Last night she would have knelt happily by
the open window and called out a hushed
"Bravo," to the singer.</p>

<p>Now she lay perfectly still after the song
ceased.</p>

<p>"It is because there isn't any other girl
here," she reflected. "He is a fashionable man
with countless friends. I am a dancing-teacher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
whom he forgets in town and always will forget.&mdash;That's
the most beautiful voice in the
world," she thought with swift irrelevance; but
Edgar, looking up at the windows, saw only
blankness. He smiled to himself. He felt that
she was not asleep.</p>

<p>The moon shed a wondrous luminous glow in
the clear heavens as it sailed above him. The
"man" looked into vast space as though no
such hilarity as that of his earlier mood had
been possible.</p>

<p>Edgar sang again. The higher the range of
the song, with the more ease did his voice thrill
the still night.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">"Oh, Moon of my delight, that knows no wane,</div>
    <div class="verse">The Moon of heaven is rising once again.</div>
    <div class="verse">How oft hereafter rising shall she look</div>
    <div class="verse">Through this same garden after me in vain!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">And when thyself with shining foot shall pass</div>
    <div class="verse">Among the guests star-scattered on the grass,</div>
    <div class="verse">And in thy joyous errand reach the spot where I made one,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Turn down an empty glass!"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Violet did not know when or how she reached
the window, but the ending of the song found
her kneeling there, sobbing quietly, her head
buried on her crossed arms. The moonlight
fell on her shining hair. Edgar saw her and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
springing up, came near, careful to keep in
shadow, for other window shades had risen.</p>

<p>"Violet!" he called softly.</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>"Violet!" he said again. A hand white in the
moonlight motioned him away, and he believed
that she was weeping. Tears of sympathy, of
triumph, sprang to his own eyes. So before very
long would hundreds be shaken by his art.</p>

<p>"Just say good night, Violet," he begged
softly; but she would not look up. She waved
her hand again, and her shade came down.</p>

<p>Only one week since she had come to the
island and it seemed months. Her aunt's words
had pierced what she knew now had been a
hope. How could she have been so insane as to
hope it! Even given such a wild supposition as
that Edgar Fabian would marry a nobody,
what comfort or peace was in store for his wife?
Violet had seen a play called "The Concert,"
in which a wife had been obliged to share her
artist husband with a miscellaneous lot of female
admirers. Better a thousand times to marry a
shoemaker or any other obscure body and so be
left to his undisturbed possession.</p>

<p>Aunt Amy was terribly right. More right
than she knew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span></p>

<p>Violet crept back to bed in a tumult of sensible
reasoning, accompanying which was an intoxicating
obbligato of divine music, which
sang and sang through her excited brain.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Edgar, strolling back deliberately
through the field, smiled at his own thoughts.
So the mocking eyes had been quenched. What
a fine combination that girl was: so spirited, so
sincere, so temperamental.</p>

<p>Kathleen's appeal recurred to him. "She's
right, I suppose," he reflected. "After smelling
hothouse flowers all winter, the wild rose is alluring;
but&mdash;" his further thoughts were vague;
but they comprised a virtuous intention of fair
play towards the girl whom he had left weeping
at the feet of his genius.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Kathleen sprang to a sitting posture as
Philip approached the hammock, and sitting on
its edge, swung gently.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, smiling, "aren't we going to
the rocks?"</p>

<p>"Oh, are we?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. I was afraid I shouldn't get
back before you had gone. I was afraid you and
Edgar might be making the most of the opportunity
for a fraternal <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tte--tte</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span></p>

<p>"We were; but we found the piazza satisfactory
for it."</p>

<p>"Blas creatures!" returned Phil. "Hurry,
Kathleen," he added eagerly. "Get your
coat."</p>

<p>"I wonder if mother may not need me."</p>

<p>"No one needs you so much as I do to-night,"
was the impulsive response. "The
Villa finished, a summer's work before me, a
full moon, a rising tide. I feel as if I could
hardly contain myself to-night, and I've been
holding my wings folded, and listening to Miss
Foster and Eliza deplore the high price of fruit,
and sympathizing with Miss Manning's headache,
and holding wool for Mrs. Wright, all the
time in a prickly heat for fear you would be
gone somewhere; and then to get over here and
find you lying like a little white cloud in the
hammock&mdash;it's just like everything else that
happens to me&mdash;just the best thing in the
world!"</p>

<p>Kathleen laughed at the boyish joy of his
tone. "Well, I'll see if mother needs me," she
said, and went into the house and to her
mother's room.</p>

<p>The moonlight streamed across the floor and
the figure on the bed turned. "Is that you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
Kathleen?" asked the prostrate one, through
her nose.</p>

<p>"Yes, how are you feeling, dear? Can I do
anything for you?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, Kathleen. If you've had enough
of the piazza, you might light the lamp and
read to me a little while."</p>

<p>The simple request magnified itself to a disaster.
Kathleen frowned, not at her mother, but
at herself. Was this all the progress she had
made?</p>

<p>"Shall I leave Phil alone?" she asked quietly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian revived. "I thought he was
over at the Wrights."</p>

<p>"He was; but he just came home. Violet had
a headache, too."</p>

<p>"Where is Edgar?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Oh, then, stay with him. It's too bad for a
headache in every house to spoil his evening. I
wonder if I couldn't get down to the piazza.
Perhaps I'd feel better in the fresh air."</p>

<p>A little pulse, its existence hitherto unsuspected,
began doing queer things in Kathleen's
throat.</p>

<p>"Phil wants to go down to the rocks," she
said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, why doesn't he? He was mooning all
over the island alone last night."</p>

<p>"He thinks I am going with him. I came in
for my coat. Shall I tell him you need me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. Go with him. And don't speak to
me when you come in. I shall be asleep. I'm
feeling better."</p>

<p>Kathleen came over to the bed and kissed her
mother, and Mrs. Fabian patted her hand.
"Tell Phil I wish I could go, too," she said with
nasal sleepiness.</p>

<p>Kathleen smiled, and going to her own room
took a white polo coat and hurried downstairs.</p>

<p>Phil met her with relief, and she gave him a
couple of cushions.</p>

<p>"I began to think," he said, "that she did
want you."</p>

<p>"Only for a minute," returned Kathleen.
"She sent word she wished she was able to come
with us."</p>

<p>The girl looked up at her companion as they
moved down on the grass and he smiled at her
with bravado.</p>

<p>"Not one polite lie to-night," he answered;
"I want you all to myself. Think how seldom
it has happened."</p>

<p>Kathleen laughed from sheer contentment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think Cap'n James is the only one who
has seen you alone," she replied.</p>

<p>"He's been a trump: and now," Phil inflated
his lungs and looked about the irregular
outline of the island lying in sheeted silver, and
at the great lighthouses flashing in the distance,
"I have a foothold in this paradise."</p>

<p>Their destination was the spot where rocks
rose highest on the island's shore, turning the
rising tide into boiling cauldrons of white foam,
and meeting the tremendous impact of the great
waves with jagged granite shelves that flung the
compact water high in fountains of diamonds.
Giant power, giant unrest, fascinating beauty
glittering with phosphorescence, and silvered
for miles with moonlight.</p>

<p>"Let me help you, Kathleen," said Phil, offering
his hand.</p>

<p>"'Bred and bawn in a briar patch,'" she responded,
springing lightly over the rocks.</p>

<p>"I follow you, then," he answered; and
Kathleen led the way to a partly sheltered
nook, too inaccessible for most less-accustomed
visitors, and so, remote from certain other
figures which loomed penguin-like on points of
rock.</p>

<p>"Father thinks he made the mistake of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
life in not buying the island outright," said the
girl; "then there wouldn't be any penguins."</p>

<p>"Supposing you had bought the Villa Chantecler?
Where would I be?" asked Phil, as he
settled down a little below the seat she had
chosen, and tried to put the second cushion behind
her back.</p>

<p>"Not at all," she said, turning to him.
"Share and share alike." She laughed softly.
"When I'm married, I'm going to have the
tenderloin cut in two. Once in a while a husband
wants his wife to have it all, but mostly
I've noticed the wife expects the husband to
have it all."</p>

<p>"That's like my mother," said Phil, resting
his elbow on the discarded cushion. "I have the
most wonderful mother."</p>

<p>"I know you have." Kathleen met the eyes
lifted to her with a gaze as grave as their own
and a sympathy that opened the flood-gates to
all that was pressing in her companion's heart
to-night.</p>

<p>"No one but myself knows how wonderful,"
said Phil, looking back at the water, something
swelling in his throat. After a pause he went
on. "We never had much money, and I
couldn't pull away and do what I wished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
That would be no return for my father's efforts
and denials for me. Mother understood. Her
whole life was a living example of self-denial and
courage. She taught me to think clearly and
showed me the value of noble-mindedness,
virtue, and controlling love. It was her splendid
patience and wisdom that gave me education
and standing-room in the world."</p>

<p>Kathleen did not speak, but he felt her receptivity.</p>

<p>"It was very early when I began to think and
dream and plan along entirely different lines
from those my lot promised. My whole being
from a child cried out for artistic expression;
and what pathetic outbursts there were! I understand
it now. Doesn't it seem natural for a
child born in the month of May with a mother
like a Madonna, sweet and gentle, to chase butterflies
and pick flowers for their beauty and
fragrance? And that child&mdash;I can't remember
when he didn't long to create; but firmly, day
by day, he was urged toward the practical.
Create! Yes; but let it be machinery; money.</p>

<p>"The marble building with its sculpture
against the blue of the sky, the painting that
makes men wonder, the book that sets their
hearts to throbbing&mdash;that was what I craved;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
and often lost my head in craving, my whole
being vibrating with a great cry of joy in the
thought of such creation. Can't you see it? The
month of May&mdash;and the flowers&mdash;and God's
universe&mdash;and the boy!"</p>

<p>The last word choked in Phil's throat.</p>

<p>"Your mother," said Kathleen in a low voice.
"She understood."</p>

<p>Phil looked up, and surprised the tenderness,
the comprehension in the face bent toward him.
"She understood," he returned slowly, "but she
thought she saw her duty. I went to college. I
forgot her many times, and every time I was a
fool. At last, I came out and was put to the
treadmill; but in my last year at school a wonderful
thing happened to my mother. A Mr.
Tremaine visited our cabin and left with her a
little book. Sometime I will tell you about it if
you care to know; but it made a great difference
in her life. My work in the mine seemed typical
of my life. The grime, the clank of machinery,
the perfunctory drudgery, and the hand's
breath of blue sky above. I crushed my longings
and tried to be practical. Could purgatory
be worse than, with such a nature, to be
caged in underground gloom? The glimpse of
sky was like my mother's eyes with their joy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
their knowledge. She talked to me, she permeated
me with the new point of view; the new
strength; the new patience. My father praised
my efficiency, and then suddenly the nightmare
was broken by a message as from heaven&mdash;you
know the rest!" Philip turned quickly, and
again met his companion's speaking eyes.</p>

<p>"Kathleen, can you forgive me!" he exclaimed.
"This has been an orgy of egotism!"
Even as he gazed, the dark eyes veiled themselves.
Only then he realized how wide-open
the doors had been thrown.</p>

<p>"I thank you for telling me," she said, with
her direct look.</p>

<p>"I seem," he answered, with a vague unrest,&mdash;"I
seem always to have been going to tell
you. There is&mdash;there is no one but you to
whom I could talk like that." He stared out on
the water, then changed the position of the
cushion.</p>

<p>"Was that Mr. Tremaine a publisher?" asked
Kathleen.</p>

<p>"I don't know. Mother has always wished
she might know who he was."</p>

<p>"There is a Mr. Tremaine who lives in Gramercy
Park who is a friend of father's."</p>

<p>"Gramercy Park?" repeated Phil, and sud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>denly
remembered. "Then I believe his son
and heir was my first and only patron. I made
a picture for a small Tremaine one day in the
park with Violet Manning."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be odd if it turned out to be
the same?" said Kathleen.</p>

<p>A magnificent burst of spray clattering in
myriad drops on the rock near them warned
them that their tenure of the place was short.</p>

<p>The girl smiled. "I think, as we have spoken
of Mr. Tremaine, I must return your confidence
with another"; and Phil, looking up suddenly,
saw a new shy consciousness in the slender face
which was for some reason disagreeable.</p>

<p>"Don't tell me to-night, Kathleen!" he said
impulsively.</p>

<p>"Why not?" she asked, wondering.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he answered honestly;
"only that everything is perfect. What you
tell me might change it. Any change would be
for the worse."</p>

<p>Kathleen smiled thoughtfully into space.</p>

<p>"I suppose," she said, with a little shrug,
"if you had urged me I might have popped
back into my shell. I'm terribly at home in
a shell! But as it is I think I'm going to tell
you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span></p>

<p>Phil looked at the delicate face, smiling in the
moonlight.</p>

<p>"Is it something you have made up your
mind to do?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, looking at him, surprised.
"How did you guess?"</p>

<p>"Then don't tell me till to-morrow. I want
to think that this won't end&mdash;that it will always
be a rising tide and&mdash;and we watching
it together."</p>

<p>That newly acquired pulse of Kathleen's asserted
itself again, but she swallowed past it
resolutely. "Oh, I shall still be able to watch
the rising tide&mdash;once in a while," she answered,
laughing. "But I'm going to tell you.
I'm writing a little book. There!"</p>

<p>"What?" cried Phil.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I'm going to publish it. Mr. Tremaine
likes the idea. He is the only one I've
told."</p>

<p>"And is that all?" asked Phil eagerly.</p>

<p>"All!" Kathleen regarded him with mock
indignation. The little pulse prevented its being
genuine. "Is all you're going to do, just to
paint pictures, Mr. Sidney?"</p>

<p>"Why, I think that's bully," exclaimed
Phil, turning so suddenly as to test the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
sharpness of his rocky couch. "Tell me about
it."</p>

<p>"Well, for the past year, I have been bewitched
by the microscope. It reveals a world
that we are too clumsy to discern. The idea
occurred to me to write a series of microscopic
fairy tales."</p>

<p>"Fine! Fine!"</p>

<p>"It's great fun. And of course they will be
illustrated."</p>

<p>"Who's going to do it?"</p>

<p>"You."</p>

<p>Phil looked up quickly. She was laughing
and blushing. "Of course you wouldn't consider
it," she said, "but there might be money
in it. How do you feel toward pot-boilers?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Kathleen. Tell me more.
What sort of illustrations?"</p>

<p>"Well, you saw me with that moss yesterday
that I had brought up out of the woods?
The slide I was making was to be the design for
a tree in the illustration. I thought to make the
pictures educational in a way. To put in a
corner of the page what the original was. Moss,
seaweed, an aphide, or whatever it happened to
be."</p>

<p>"What a pretty idea!" said Phil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course, you don't want to do it, though,"
she went on in a different tone. "Just as your
studio is finished, and you are aching to paint."</p>

<p>"It's good of you to think of me," replied the
artist warmly. "I don't know that I could do
that work. I should have to satisfy Mr. Tremaine
with a sample. We couldn't put our educational
tips on the pictures, but there could be
a thin cover for each illustration with the description
on a corner of that."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, much better," agreed Kathleen.</p>

<p>They talked a little longer and the splendid
tide suddenly splashed them with glittering
spray.</p>

<p>"A broad hint," laughed Kathleen, springing
up. "We must go back."</p>

<p>Phil sighed. "I'm sorry," he said, and getting
reluctantly to his feet, he started to give
his hand to Kathleen, then remembering that
she preferred independence, he picked up the
cushions and started ahead of her.</p>

<p>They had nearly crossed the rocks when a cry
from her arrested him.</p>

<p>He turned. She had sunk down in the moonlight.</p>

<p>"Oh, how dull of me!" she cried. "I'm used
to my rubber-soled shoes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span></p>

<p>"What! Turned your ankle?" Phil flung the
cushions over upon the grass, and hurried to
her.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so."</p>

<p>"I ought to have helped you," said Phil, with
contrition, "but I thought you preferred&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do. I'm a regular mountain goat."
Kathleen was half laughing in a way that
showed her pain.</p>

<p>Phil lifted her gently, and she went on:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Everybody knows nowadays that the best
way to treat a strain is to walk right ahead.
Oh!"</p>

<p>"Yes, that may do on flat ground," said
Phil; "I'm a mountain goat too, so don't be
afraid"; and, lifting her in his arms, he carried
her over the remaining rocks and set her down
upon the grassy bank.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">TIDES</p>


<p>Philip paused a moment when he reached the
grassy bank.</p>

<p>"You're quite sure you wish to walk?" he
said.</p>

<p>"I certainly am," she returned with an effort
at lightness. "It's the best thing I can do, now
that I've been so careless."</p>

<p>He set her down gently, and picked up the
cushions with one hand while he put the other
under her arm, and they started; but there was
no path; the points of granite and the grassy
hummocks made difficult walking for sound
feet. Phil felt his companion's sudden limps and
cringes, the while she was talking valiantly of
the satisfaction it was to feel that a little pain
didn't matter, so long as one knew that the
best thing for a strain was exercise; but all the
time it seemed to her that home was miles away,
and that this Transgressors' Boulevard would
never end.</p>

<p>Phil smiled down at the dark uncovered head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
so near his shoulder; then as she sank in an unexpected
hollow:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pluck is all very well, Kathleen," he said,
"but I'm going to pick you up again."</p>

<p>"No, no, Phil! You could never carry me
home. I'm much too heavy to be doing these
foolish things." Tears of vexation stood in the
girl's eyes.</p>

<p>"I needn't carry you home," he returned
quietly, "but it is all my fault that you slipped.
As soon as we get to level ground you shall try
again. Cushions will be safe in Arcadia, I fancy,"
he added, storing them at the foot of a rock they
were passing. "I can come back for them."</p>

<p>"Put this heavy polo coat with them," said
Kathleen, trying not to cry. "No need of carrying
any more than you have to. Oh, Phil,
really! I could hop. Couldn't I hop if you lifted
me on one side?"</p>

<p>"We'll hop, skip, and jump when we get
on the level," he returned, wrapping the coat
carefully about her, and taking her up again.</p>

<p>"Put your arm around my neck, please.
There we are." He moved on at a good pace.
"Can't you feel that it's easy?"</p>

<p>"I'm so ashamed to make you this trouble."
Kathleen's lip quivered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm so ashamed that you are hurt, but I
need the exercise," rejoined her bearer. "What
am I going to do now that I don't have to struggle
with the Villa? Have you a rowboat?"</p>

<p>"Yes," returned Kathleen, in a small voice.</p>

<p>They were approaching a cottage with sightless
midnight eyes. She had no idea what time
it was, but devoutly hoped they were the only
persons awake on the island. It was ridiculous
to be carried about like this, and a terrible imposition
on an innocent guest; but how wonderful
he was, striding along from hummock to
hummock with apparent ease.</p>

<p>"Then I'll do some rowing, if you'll let me.
Do you like to row?"</p>

<p>"Yes," came again in such a small, choked
voice, that Phil suddenly turned his head and
his face came close to Kathleen's. The elegant
remote Miss Fabian, with the slumbrous eyes
and the red-brown hair, was a helpless child in
his arms.</p>

<p>"Are you suffering?" he asked, and such a
note of tenderness sounded suddenly in his
voice that the girl's heart gave a great throb.</p>

<p>"Only in my mind," she faltered, trying to
laugh. "You'll set me down as soon as we reach
the point, won't you? It's easy from there."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not very easy from there, but Kathleen
set her teeth, and walked it, leaning on Phil's
arm, and sometimes stopping to rest.</p>

<p>"And I thought it was such a small island,"
she said with a little sighing laugh when at last
the home piazza was reached.</p>

<p>Philip helped her upstairs to her room.</p>

<p>"Shall I knock on your mother's door?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"No, indeed. I can get on perfectly well
now." She held out her hand. "Will you forgive
me?"</p>

<p>He took it and looked straight into her eyes
without speaking.</p>

<p>For an instant he held her hand, still mute,
then turned, and instead of going to his room
went downstairs again.</p>

<p>Kathleen, closing her door softly, heard him.
She stood a moment perfectly still, her lambent
eyes looking into space, the long straight
lines of her white coat shining in the dim
room.</p>

<p>"If it should be!" she thought with awe. "If
it should be!"</p>

<p>Philip went out on the porch. The tide was
receding and dragging in and out the stones of
the beach. He frowned thoughtfully at the roll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>ing
expanse. "This is disturbing," he reflected.
His blood was pumping and dragging mightily
at locked doors of his own which he knew must
be locked for years to come.</p>

<p>"And even then it cannot be Kathleen who
opens them," he reminded himself. While she
was flashing about to fashionable functions
in her limousine the coming season, he would
still be planning which meal to make the substantial
one of the day.</p>

<p>"The cushions!" he thought suddenly, and,
finding relief in action, he began running back
with long, even strides, through the silent, silvered
fields.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Before ten o'clock the next morning Edgar
presented himself at the farmhouse to make
inquiries for the invalid. He was eager to begin
treating Violet right; and as a commencement he
brought a box of bonbons which he had ordered
from the city before that resolution was made.
However, flowers and candy were conventional
attentions. So were books. He reflected that
no one could criticize his giving Violet a
marked copy of Tennyson.</p>

<p>"She isn't here," Mrs. Wright told him
when he reached the house. "She has gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
somewhere to get an extra coat of tan and see
the tide come in."</p>

<p>"Why didn't I come sooner!" exclaimed
Edgar, vexed. "I thought her headache&mdash;I
thought she wouldn't be up early."</p>

<p>"Oh, I think you must have exorcised that
last night," said Mrs. Wright. "How we all
enjoyed the medicine! Will you promise to sing
every night if one of us will fall ill?"</p>

<p>Edgar smiled and twisted his mustache.
"We have a lame duck over at our house," he
said. "Kathleen managed to slip on the rocks
last night. She's as plucky as they make 'em,
though. She's limping around. Phil was with
her&mdash;not very bright of him, I must say."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sorry he has that cloud over his
first morning at the studio," returned Mrs.
Wright. "I saw him go in there an hour
ago."</p>

<p>"You're sure Violet isn't there?" asked Edgar
quickly.</p>

<p>"Oh, perfectly," rejoined Mrs. Wright quietly.
"We're as much warned off the Villa as ever,
now, you know. I hope he is going to do great
things."</p>

<p>"Yes, I hope so," said Edgar absently. "This
full sunlight isn't particularly good for Violet's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
head. Don't you think I'd better find her and
get her out of it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's the steadiest little head in the world.
Last night was simply the exception that proves
the rule."</p>

<p>"Well, then, she'll be fit for tennis. I'm going
to find her and see if we can't have some
singles before dinner."</p>

<p>"All right, if you can find her."</p>

<p>Edgar tossed his head. "Perhaps I couldn't
put a girdle 'round the earth, but this island's
a cinch"; and with the beribboned box under
his arm and the sun glinting on his polished blond
head, Edgar set off running toward the rocks
where Kathleen had met her slip.</p>

<p>Perhaps, he reflected, it was just as well that
Violet had been <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors de combat</i> last evening. If
they had come down here in the moonlight, and
he had sung, and she had turned upon him that
wonderful, confiding, devout look which warmed
every fibre of his vanity, there is no telling
what he might have said or done. He was
shrewd enough to know that Mrs. Larrabee's
rebuff had caused a rebound in which just such
an innocent, womanly girl as Violet Manning
could catch his heart in both hands. She had
laughed at him yesterday afternoon, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
force her to capitulate he might have done
something foolish in the evening. Now that
pitfall&mdash;the time, the place, and the girl&mdash;was
past, and the bright clear winds of morning
found him forewarned and forearmed; but
friendly, perfectly friendly. He thoroughly
liked Violet Manning.</p>

<p>All this time he was running toward the show-place
at high tide, the precipitous rocks whose
walls and crannies repulsed the crashing waves,
causing a never-ending series of fountains, and
cascades of crystal water.</p>

<p>A few penguins in shade hats studded the
heights this morning, but Violet was not among
them. He walked past slowly, scanning the
rocks. A few rods farther on, a small harbor
pierced the island's side. Its farther bank was
soft with evergreens; a sturdy growth of tall
spruces which fixed their roots amid the inhospitable
rocks.</p>

<p>An artist had set up his easel on the near
shore, and was sitting on a camp-stool before
it, working busily. A large straw hat was
crowded down to the tops of his ears to thwart
the wind, and Edgar wondered who might be
the competitor of the painter who was working
away at the Villa Chantecler. He glanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
carelessly at the artist and then renewed his
scrutiny of the rocks; being so engrossed, that
the next time his gaze went forward, he saw that
a girl was lying on the rock near the easel, leaning
on her elbow and alternately watching the
artist and the sea.</p>

<p>Edgar suspected the truth with a wave of
anger. How could Phil be in two places at once?
He had allowed Kathleen to slip on the rocks.
Probably he had been absent-minded. This
had been planned for; Mrs. Wright couldn't
have known it.</p>

<p>He strode forward.</p>

<p>"Good morning!" he said, with awe-inspiring
dignity.</p>

<p>"Oh, hello," returned Violet carelessly, turning
her head so as to see the newcomer.</p>

<p>Could this nonchalant girl be she who had
wept at the window!</p>

<p>"I went over to the house to see how you
were," said Edgar severely, "and Mrs. Wright
said you were watching the tide."</p>

<p>"Yes," returned Violet, lazy in the sun,
"but I found something so much better to
watch."</p>

<p>"You can't see anything from there," declared
Edgar, speaking crisply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you allow that, Mr. Sidney?" asked the
girl.</p>

<p>"I allow anything but people to talk to me,"
said Phil, busy with the blues and greens of the
water.</p>

<p>"There, you see!" said Violet accusingly.
"He hadn't said a word of reproach to me before
you came"; and the little minx allowed
herself to throw a devoted glance in the direction
of the artist's hat. If the mouse were
going ultimately to make its escape, surely the
kitten was entitled to whatever fun it could
find in the situation.</p>

<p>Edgar pulled himself together.</p>

<p>"It's great just now," he said. "Don't you
want to come out on the rocks, and see the
row?"</p>

<p>Violet shook her head and touched her finger
to her lips warningly.</p>

<p>Edgar scowled and looked at Phil's swift
brush. Confound the girl, how was he to treat
her magnanimously if she wouldn't give him
an opportunity?</p>

<p>He held out the beribboned box and raised
his eyebrows, gesturing with his head toward
the rocks.</p>

<p>"Is there a string tied to it?" asked Violet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
with a saucy, lazy smile; and Edgar lifted his
chin superbly and tossed the box into her
lap.</p>

<p>"The only girl here," she reflected; for she felt
tempted to be flattered by the implied forethought.</p>

<p>"How perfectly sweet," she said and opened
the luxurious box. Rising to her knees she lifted
a chocolate in the little tongs and put it in
Philip's mouth.</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mille remerciments</i>," he mumbled; "but
don't do it again, please."</p>

<p>"Phil wants to be alone," said Edgar. "Can't
you see that?" He held out his hand to Violet
to rise. She ignored it, but rose with supple
grace.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "if little boys will come and
chatter to me, I suppose I shall have to go. It's
been so interesting, Mr. Sidney. That's going
to be wonderful. I hope you'll let me watch you
again sometime."</p>

<p>"You didn't really want to stay there, did
you?" asked Edgar, when they had begun to
climb out on the rocks at a point where there
were no other gazers.</p>

<p>"Indeed I did, marplot," returned the girl,
"but three's a crowd when one is painting."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, very well," said Edgar, stiffly; "I'll
stay away the next time."</p>

<p>"That's right. Do," returned Violet. "Have
a chocolate? These are delicious."</p>

<p>"No, I thank you." Edgar gave a dark
glance at his companion. He did not like her
mood.</p>

<p>"I didn't know you cared more for painting
than for music," he said.</p>

<p>"More?" she returned with wide eyes. "Oh,
no, I'm an impartial and humble admirer of all
the arts."</p>

<p>Wasn't she going to speak of last evening?
He stood in silence beside her for a space to
give her opportunity; but she was engrossed in
munching a chocolate.</p>

<p>"My!" she said, regarding the heavy, satin,
heart-shaped crimson box admiringly, "I've
gazed at these with awe in shop windows, and
then gone in and bought ten cents worth in a
striped bag. I feel so grand!"</p>

<p>"I was disappointed last night," said Edgar,
his gloomy regard changing slowly to his
best look of devotion. There was nothing for
him in Violet's eyes this morning. The expression
he craved must be brought back in order
that he might exercise care to treat her fairly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span></p>

<p>"Because I couldn't go to walk with Mr.
Sidney?" she rejoined, with the ironical gayety
Edgar hated. "I was, too; but your charming
serenade almost made up for it."</p>

<p>Edgar ground the even teeth. "I suppose it
was foolish of me to exert myself," he said. "I
probably waked you up."</p>

<p>"Oh, it didn't sound like the least bit of
exertion," replied Violet. "The ease of your
singing is really its great charm. You didn't
mind my laughing, right at the end, did you?"</p>

<p>"Laughing!"</p>

<p>"Yes; you see Miss Foster is on my side of
the house, and when you sang</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">'Turn down an empty glass,'</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>I knew she'd think it was a prohibition song,
and I nearly suffocated."</p>

<p>Edgar met her dancing eyes, and glared at
her while she ate a chocolate with relish.</p>

<p>"And I thought you were temperamental!"
he muttered.</p>

<p>"Do you wonder really that Maine is a prohibition
state?" she asked conversationally.
"Here, eat this peppermint one for me. I don't
like them," and the even teeth opened mechanically
to receive the bonbon she popped between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
them. "I mean because it's so intoxicating
here anyway. Why, I can hardly keep my feet
still this morning"; and as they were standing,
Violet, on her flat rock, and with the great crimson
heart pressed to her breast, began to clog.</p>

<p>Edgar half unconsciously moved away to
where he could see her nimble feet. "Whistle,"
she laughed. "Whistle, and I won't come to
you, my lad!"</p>

<p>Edgar whistled, he couldn't help it. Her fair
hair blowing, her sea-blue eyes shining, and her
sure feet dancing, she seemed the incarnation
of the radiant morning. He found himself patting
in rhythm, and whistling like a bird until
she tired and sank in a blue heap on the rock.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's a jolly world," she cried.</p>

<p>"And you're a jolly girl!" he exclaimed,
striding over and flinging himself down beside
her. "Why don't you teach me to do that? You
promised."</p>

<p>"I've begun twice, haven't I? You haven't
any patience."</p>

<p>"Oh, that was in the woods. What could I do
on a hillside? Teach me in the summer house
this afternoon."</p>

<p>"That's where you ought to be now, practising,"
said Violet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've put in half an hour this morning."</p>

<p>"That isn't enough. It's time for another."</p>

<p>"Oh, you want me to go, do you, so you can
go back and watch Phil?"</p>

<p>"Well, I never before had a chance to see the
wheels go 'round in a painting. Don't you think
it's wonderful?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he's a wizard. It's a pity you couldn't
go with him last night. He took Kath and she
managed to turn her ankle."</p>

<p>"So he has been telling me. I'm sorry. So
you'd rather have had mine turned? Then I
couldn't have taught you to clog, remember."</p>

<p>"No; he might not have gone mooning around
then. He might have paid more attention to
<em>you</em>."</p>

<p>Violet glanced at the speaker out of the tail of
her eye and ate a chocolate. Then she cast a
look over on the point where the easel stood.
"He is so good-looking," she sighed. "I like
smooth-faced men."</p>

<p>"My mustache is catching it next, is it?" said
Edgar irritably, twisting that treasure.</p>

<p>"Oh, I simply despise mustaches," rejoined
Violet equably; "but of course if it makes you
look older, or more dignified, or helps you in
your career, you have to wear one."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know as there's any 'have to' about
it," returned Edgar. "It's just a matter of
taste with me"; he made the addition with a
superior carelessness.</p>

<p>"So it is with me," returned Violet with
engaging frankness. "Here's another peppermint."
She picked it up in the silver tongs.
"Open your mouth and shut your eyes and I'll
give you something to make you wise."</p>

<p>Edgar jerked back his head, seized the confection
in his fingers, and scaled it across the
rocks.</p>

<p>"I loathe peppermint," he said shortly, "and
as for making me wise, you're making me wiser
every day. Will you, or will you not give me
a lesson in clogging this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"I <em>will</em>!" returned Violet, dramatically.
"You paid partly in advance last night, and
I'm the soul of honor!"</p>

<p>He met her mischievous eyes with a baffled
look. He longed to shake her. His hand lifted
mechanically to his mustache and dropped
again. He had lost faith in that, too.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">THE SON</p>


<p>When Philip returned to dinner that day he
found a strange man sitting on the veranda with
Kathleen. The table beside her was filled with
loose sheets of paper, and she was reading aloud.</p>

<p>As Phil approached she looked up.</p>

<p>"We spoke of an angel last night," she said,
"and lo, he appeared to-day. This is Mr. Tremaine,
and he knows you already."</p>

<p>Phil laid down his impedimenta and his hat,
and shook hands.</p>

<p>The grey-eyed portly stranger smiled as they
greeted. "Miss Fabian has told me so much
about you," he said, "that I am wondering if
you belong to the Sidneys who took me in in the
mountains of Montana one night five or six
years ago."</p>

<p>Philip's perfunctory gaze quickened.</p>

<p>"And you left my mother a little book?" he
asked quickly.</p>

<p>The pressure of the newcomer's handclasp
tightened. He nodded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span></p>

<p>"The very same," he said. "And you do belong
to that charming woman."</p>

<p>"You did a great deal for us, Mr. Tremaine,"
said Phil heartily.</p>

<p>"And this Kathleen child says we're not
through with each other. She wants you to illustrate
this clever little book of hers."</p>

<p>"If he will," put in the girl quickly. "You
don't know yet what small business it will be
for him to picture my stuff. Show us what you
have done this morning."</p>

<p>"I hear you are my neighbor in Gramercy
Park," said Mr. Tremaine while Phil stooped to
get his picture. "I hear that the artist who did
my son's treasure, 'The Proud Robin,' stands
before me."</p>

<p>Phil laughed and turned his canvas about.
A great wave uplifted its heavy snowy crest,
just at the point of breaking into rushing surge.</p>

<p>"Stand back," cried Kathleen, "it's coming!"
Her cheeks reddened. "You do such true
things, Phil!"</p>

<p>"Upon my word!" said Mr. Tremaine, "Miss
Fabian is right. That's really great, Mr. Sidney.
One gets the weight of the water. I think the
breadth and perception of the mountains
helped you in that. How long have you been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
so intimate with the physiognomy of old
Ocean?"</p>

<p>"I have been at this off and on for some days
in time stolen from house decoration."</p>

<p>"There is time before dinner," said Kathleen,
"and Mr. Tremaine is going to stay such
a little while, take him over to the Villa. I want
him to be sure to see it though I begrudge his
seeing it without me, too!"</p>

<p>"Sure you can't go?" asked Mr. Tremaine.</p>

<p>Kathleen looked ruefully at her right foot,
wearing a loose slipper of her mother's.</p>

<p>"That field is so rough," she said.</p>

<p>"We'll make an armchair," said Phil.</p>

<p>The girl shook her head. "No, I'll gather up
my book. Mr. Tremaine likes it, so I'm happy
though lame, and you must talk over the illustrations
together."</p>

<p>In truth she was glad that these two should
have the opportunity for a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tte--tte</i> and she
smiled happily to herself as she picked up the
flying sheets. There was color in her cheeks,
the rose-color that seemed this morning to tinge
the universe. It was such a beautiful world, and
for Mr. Tremaine suddenly to appear and to approve
her work and to meet Phil&mdash;Phil whose
eyes had seemed this morning always to see her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
and regard her reflectively, instead of looking
over or through her&mdash;all this made a wonderful
combination, a strange, sweet expectancy,
as of harmonious progressions which could but
resolve into one triumphant chord.</p>

<p>The dinner hour approached and Mrs. Fabian
came out on the piazza.</p>

<p>"How are you, poor child?" she asked with
commiseration; then meeting Kathleen's eyes,
she laughed. "Here I am pitying you, and you
look as if you'd been left a million. What is it?
Is Mr. Tremaine so pleased with your stories?"</p>

<p>"He thinks they'll do," returned Kathleen.</p>

<p>"Very modest," said Mrs. Fabian; "but I'm
quite sure from your looks that he said you were
a second Hans Christian Andersen. Keeping
it a secret from me, too! I'm a very good judge
of stories, and you might have asked my opinion
about those, at any rate."</p>

<p>"I felt very shy about it, mother, but now
I'm just bubbling with encouragement; and
perhaps Phil will make the pictures."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian regarded the rosy face admiringly.</p>

<p>"There, you see his business is coming along,
and this morning I gave him the commission to
paint our portraits."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span></p>

<p>Even this news could not dampen Kathleen's
present mood.</p>

<p>"Yours," she returned. "Remember, I told
you I refused to be perpetuated as I look now."</p>

<p>"I never saw you look as pretty as you do
to-day, in your whole life," said Mrs. Fabian,
gazing as she spoke.</p>

<p>The girl laughed from sheer satisfaction. "Is
the big head so becoming?" she returned.</p>

<p>"I saw Phil taking Mr. Tremaine over to the
studio," said Mrs. Fabian. "Edgar said this
morning he wanted to bring Violet to dinner.
He will be surprised to find Mr. Tremaine here.
We shall have quite a party. I hope they won't
all be late. If Phil and Mr. Tremaine get to
talking over at the studio they won't know
what time it is."</p>

<p>The air at the island, however, was of a nature
to create an inner monitor which called to
dinner, so the two couples soon approached
from opposite directions. Mr. Tremaine and
Phil were talking busily as they came, and
Kathleen noted Violet's crimson heart while
she drew near. She gazed questioningly at her
brother whose alert happy face turned red as
he met her eyes; but Violet was self-possessed
when Kathleen greeted her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pardon my remaining enthroned, Violet,"
she said. "I'm not precisely wasting steps to-day."</p>

<p>"I heard about it," returned the guest, coming
up the steps and meeting Mrs. Fabian. "I
do hope it's nothing serious."</p>

<p>"No, indeed. I shall soon forget it."</p>

<p>"I suppose neither of you will have a chocolate
before dessert, but they're very very good."
Violet opened the box temptingly as she took
a seat beside Kathleen.</p>

<p>"Who is that coming with Phil?" asked
Edgar.</p>

<p>"My publisher," returned Kathleen, proudly.
"Just think, Edgar! I've written some stories,
and Mr. Tremaine has accepted them!"</p>

<p>Edgar lifted his eyebrows and smiled wonderingly
into his sister's happy face. "Good
work, Kath! It may really pay to be a
highbrow. Why have you kept so still about
it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that was natural. Supposing Mr. Tremaine
had said, 'You're a nice child, Kathleen,
but your little yarns are trash.' How then!
Shouldn't I be glad nobody saw me hide my
diminished head?"</p>

<p>Edgar continued to regard her curiously. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
had never before noticed how really good-looking
Kath was.</p>

<p>Violet expressed her interest and sympathy
heartily, and while she was speaking, the other
guests arrived and Mr. Tremaine met his son's
dancing-teacher with pleasure.</p>

<p>It was a gay dinner-party, and Kathleen
glowed with satisfaction in Mr. Tremaine's
manifest interest in Phil. He could be such a
useful friend.</p>

<p>They had coffee on the veranda, and while
Edgar was planning in what manner and how
soon he could segregate himself and Violet in the
summer house, the boy whose duty it was to
bring the mail appeared with the letters. At a
sign from Mrs. Fabian he handed them to her.</p>

<p>She ran them over with a smile. "I'm always
impolite," she said, "when Mr. Fabian's letter
comes, and I think everybody will forgive me."
She laid the others on the rail beside her and
opened the letter she held.</p>

<p>"I'm hoping so much he will set the day for
coming."</p>

<p>The smiling expectancy of her face gave way
to bewilderment and incredulity as she read. No
one observed it, for Kathleen had started to
tell an island adventure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span></p>

<p>Her mother's voice broke in upon the tale.</p>

<p>"Kathleen!" she said breathlessly, "I don't
understand this letter. Father is in trouble of
some kind. He is trying to comfort me. He says
to ask you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian looked up at Kathleen whose
face was transformed while her mother spoke.
The color left it, the laughing eyes grew startled,
and she tried to rise.</p>

<p>Phil sprang to his feet, "What do you want,
Kathleen?"</p>

<p>"The letters!" she said. "See if there is one
for me?"</p>

<p>Edgar, who had been observing how remarkably
good was the line of Violet's hair at
the nape of her neck, brought his thoughts back
with difficulty to his sister. Kath was looking
frightened. What was the matter?</p>

<p>Mr. Tremaine leaned forward in his chair and
looked with serious questioning at Kathleen
while she tore open a letter from her father. Her
brow drew together as she read. Mrs. Fabian
regarded her helplessly, two sheets of paper
blowing in her fingers.</p>

<p>When finally the girl dropped her letter her
face had flushed again. She rose from her chair
with difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span></p>

<p>"I must go to father immediately," she said.</p>

<p>Phil was at her side in an instant. "You
can't do that," he returned, "but you can
send me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian's lips were parted. Edgar
frowned and looked from one to another; then
he too sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"What is this, Kath?" he asked with sudden
authority.</p>

<p>His sister regarded him absently. Edgar
would suffer, of course, but just now, in the
crucial moment, he didn't count; and she! Oh,
how could fate have been so unkind as to hamper
her at the only time in her life when it
would make any difference! A time when she
longed for wings to carry her to her father's side
and let her throw her arms around his neck.</p>

<p>She looked at Edgar's frowning, questioning
face with curious vagueness.</p>

<p>"Father has lost a great deal of money," she
said, "and friends as well, because he would not
yield to plans which he considered dishonorable.
He told me before we left that it might come;
but he had no idea the crisis was right upon
him. Oh, I must, I must go to father&mdash;at once&mdash;at
once!" The girl limped toward the door.</p>

<p>"You can't go to-day," said Phil decidedly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
"but I can. I will go on this next boat with Mr.
Tremaine. Tell me what&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What are you talking about!" It was Edgar
who spoke, and his tone turned every eye upon
him. His nostrils were dilated and his eyes
looked dark. "Father in trouble! I'm going to
him, of course."</p>

<p>He tried to speak quietly, but there was a
thrill in his tone that echoed in Kathleen's heart.
She knew as she looked at the new stern expression
of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">debonair</i> countenance that in that
minute the boy had become a man.</p>

<p>Violet gazed at him with a swelling heart
and swept poor Phil with a supercilious glance
wholly undeserved, but of which he was unconscious.</p>

<p>Edgar hastened into the house to make his
preparations and Kathleen and Phil exchanged
a look.</p>

<p>"It's all for the best," said Phil in a low tone.
"Edgar will find himself."</p>

<p>Kathleen's hands were clasped on her breast.
Mrs. Fabian regarded her beseechingly. "What
do you mean?" she cried, her voice breaking
hysterically. "Money and friends! What do
you mean?"</p>

<p>Kathleen sank into the chair beside her. "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
mean that father is an honest man," she said
proudly.</p>

<p>Mr. Tremaine came to Mrs. Fabian's other
side. "I was at college with your husband," he
said. "Henry Fabian was always doing fine
things. I suspect that this last move, whatever
it is, is one of the finest. I would trust him before
I would myself."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian looked from one to the other,
tears running down her cheeks.</p>

<p>"I can't have my portrait painted, Phil," she
faltered. "We're very poor."</p>

<p>Phil knelt down before her and put his arms
around her and she rested her head on his shoulder
and sobbed quietly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not poor," he said; "but what if you
are, Aunt Isabel? Look about at this beautiful
place with everything to make people happy.
Health and freedom and honor beside; and Edgar
will bring his father here and everything will
straighten out and we shall make him forget his
troubles."</p>

<p>"No motor, Phil," came from the sobbing woman.
"I can't imagine living without a motor."</p>

<p>"Indeed you can. You're going to show Mr.
Fabian what a good sport he married; and we're
all going to cheer him up and make him forget<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
his nightmare before fall. You have everything
that's real left&mdash;unless Mr. Fabian breaks
down under this strain," added Phil artfully.</p>

<p>He had struck the right note. Mrs. Fabian
lifted her head and wiped her eyes wildly. "I'm
going with Edgar," she cried. "Henry may be
ill. I shall go."</p>

<p>"No, dear mother," said Kathleen, gently
taking her hand. "Let Edgar manage this
alone. He will wire us at once."</p>

<p>It was nearly time for the boat and Edgar
came out of the house with his bag. All his
machinations of the morning had not succeeded
in bringing to Violet's eyes the expression that
grew there when she saw him ready to start on
his hard journey. Speechless and unsmiling he
pressed her hand, then kissed his mother and
listened to her exhortations. Mr. Tremaine was
ready, and together they started toward the
wharf.</p>

<p>Philip was going to accompany them, but his
aunt clung to him.</p>

<p>"Stay with us, Phil," she begged. "You are
my son, too."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. Fabian, heavy-lidded from a sleepless
night, was working at the desk in his private<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
office, when the door opened and closed quietly
and quickly, and he looked up to see Edgar
standing beside him. An added cloud passed
over his face.</p>

<p>The young man saw it and he paid for many
a misdemeanor in the pang it gave him.</p>

<p>"Father, I've come to see if I can be of any
use," he said.</p>

<p>Mr. Fabian pushed his chair back and looked
up at his visitor, the deep line in his forehead
deeper.</p>

<p>"I know I have no experience, and little business
sense; but if you'll take the trouble to explain
the situation to me, I'll try to understand
as I've never before tried to do anything; and
I can at least carry out your instructions to the
letter."</p>

<p>Mr. Fabian continued to gaze up into the sunburned
face and the eyes that regarded him
with steady purpose.</p>

<p>"I've lost a lot of money for you, my boy,"
he said. "Quite a half of everything I possessed."</p>

<p>"And come out clean," returned the other
promptly. "Good for you."</p>

<p>Mr. Fabian kept silence, studying him for
another space.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span></p>

<p>"My son," he said at last, slowly, as if to himself.
"I have a son"; and he held out his hand.</p>

<p>Edgar clasped it in silence. Then he spoke
again. "I haven't had any breakfast, and of
course I couldn't sleep; so my head isn't worth
much just now. Can you spare time to come
out and talk to me while I eat, or shall I go
alone?"</p>

<p>Mr. Fabian rose and his heavy eyes had
brightened. "Neither of us will go alone, after
this," he said.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">A TIDAL WAVE</p>


<p>Mr. Fabian's firm stand resulted in a dissolution
of his partnership, and very soon he was
able to repair with Edgar to the island.</p>

<p>The son had found the man-to-man relationship
with his father a strangely sweet one; and
by the time they reached the island&mdash;so deeply
had his father's steadfastness and suffering
worked upon Edgar, he had no other plan than
that of rejuvenating the tired man's strained
nerves. Therefore, when Mr. Fabian reached
the heavenly calm of his hill cottage, he found
his wife and daughter ready to accompany him
on a cruise. Mrs. Fabian, lukewarm sailor
though she was, was as fully prepared as Kathleen;
and with scarcely any delay they all
started out on the yacht. Mr. Fabian urged
Phil to join the party, but he could not leave
his work, and in any case would not add himself
to a family party at this time. He and Violet
stood on the shore and watched the white sails
swell as they caught the wind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span></p>

<p>Edgar had been so absorbed in his father and
his plans that she had but a flying glimpse of
him after his return from New York; but it
flattered her to observe that he had left his
mustache in the metropolis.</p>

<p>Philip's assiduous work during the summer
resulted in finished pictures and numerous
sketches, all of which he carried back in the
autumn to the stable where Pat met him with
effusion.</p>

<p>"Sure 'tis a red Injun ye are!" he exclaimed
at sight of his lodger's mahogany tints.</p>

<p>"Yes, and next summer, Pat, if I'm not a
pauper, you're coming up there to get a red nose,
too," responded Phil.</p>

<p>The first step toward independence had been
made. He had finished the illustrations for
Kathleen's fairy tales, and but a few days after
his return, Mr. Tremaine came to the studio
to welcome him and show him the first copy of
the book; for it was October before Phil had consented
to leave his enthralling Villa, being finally
shooed out by Eliza who insisted that he either
come over to them and live in a Christian house,
or go back to his warm stable.</p>

<p>Phil was eager for news that Mr. Tremaine
could give him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aunt Isabel has written me very little," he
said. "I know they are settled in an apartment
near the park, but how are they all, and how
do they bear the change?"</p>

<p>"Wonderfully well," was the reply. "Mrs.
Fabian is the one to feel the pinch, of course.
Kathleen, not at all. She has too much resource
within herself to be dependent, and then there
are not a few people of influence who would find
a Van Ruysler if she hid herself on the East
Side."</p>

<p>It was true, Mrs. Fabian lived too much in
reflected glory to suffer loneliness, and as the
winter went on Kathleen drew her into artistic
circles where Philip's interests lay, and gradually
she gained much pride and satisfaction in
the understanding of technical terms, and
learned not to discuss pictures. She even occasionally
felt some remorse in the remembrance
of Mrs. Ballard and was conscious of a wish that
she might have sympathized with her more.</p>

<p>The startling event in the family, however,
was provided by Edgar. The great Mazzini was
as good as his word, and Edgar Fabian started
in at once, on his return to New York, as a
teacher of the vocal art. Successful is too mild
a word to be applied to the young tenor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
Mazzini procured him opportunities to sing in
drawing-rooms where he had heretofore been
the entertained. He sent pupils to him, and they
advertised him <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">con amore</i>. Before the winter
was over he became a fad. He drew a good salary
in a fashionable church. Other musicians
sneered at him as a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">poseur</i>, and turned their
lunch tables into knockers' clubs to ease their
minds concerning the vagaries of this upstart.</p>

<p>Edgar, with his characteristic self-assurance
gave full play to the moods of which he had
spoken in the past to Violet. Perhaps he was not
blind to the fact that it was good advertising,
but in any case it was a temperamental fling
which gave him the utmost satisfaction.</p>

<p>He had different sets of hangings made,
divan covers, cushions, et cetera, easily removed
and placed in a box couch, so that his pupils
sometimes found a purple studio, sometimes a
crimson, sometimes one in luminous gold. None
knew beforehand in which mood the wonderful
young <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">maestro</i> would be found; and they talked
of him with bated breath.</p>

<p>His sister took the liberty, early in his career,
of laughing at this ebullition of fancy, but she
soon found that Edgar took himself seriously,
and she repressed her smiles; for nothing suc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>ceeds
like success; and Edgar Van Ruysler
Fabian was an idol whom it was not her place
to knock from his pedestal.</p>

<p>Violet Manning meanwhile was industriously
proceeding with her own teaching. As some of
it lay in fashionable schools, she heard echoes
of Edgar's popularity, and she and her housemates
often attended the church where he sang.
He came to their apartment occasionally and
relaxed from the strain of living up to the ideal
of his admirers whom he terrorized grandly at
moments, after the most approved Mazzini
methods.</p>

<p>Once he had the three bachelor maids at a
chafing-dish supper at his studio. He was in a
red mood that night, and the crimson hangings
reminded Violet of the glowing heart which
always lay on her dressing-table.</p>

<p>The function was an informal and jolly one.
One of the men present was Edgar's accompanist,
and he had played for Violet to dance.
It was a triumphant occasion for the girl. She
looked charming in a thin iridescent gown which
changed with the blues and greens of the sea
while she floated and pirouetted, as light and
tireless as thistledown. Edgar's eyes were
bright with pride in her and she was wildly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
applauded, sharing the honors of the evening
with him.</p>

<p>Edgar sang the better for the inspiration of
her, and when at her request he began, "O
moon of my delight," she closed her eyes, shutting
out the gay company and the diffused rosy
light. Again she saw him stretched on the grass
in the silvery radiance of a still, still night.</p>

<p>"I think Mr. Fabian is in love with Violet,"
said Regina afterward, privately, to Roxana.</p>

<p>"I think he is in love with himself," returned
Roxana; "and I take off my hat to Violet, for
I believe she knows it, too. I'm afraid if I were
her age and he wanted me, I'd marry him even
if I knew he'd beat me all the time he wasn't
singing."</p>

<p>Her housemates noticed that Violet never
spoke of Edgar, and they drew their conclusions.
She had a sketch of his head done by Phil in an
idle moment, pinned up on her wall. That and
the bonbon box were the only evidences of the
acquaintance save those occasional calls with
which Edgar favored the apartment. The fact
that he came at all was important, for his engagements
were legion.</p>

<p>Philip carried himself much as he had done
the winter before. Through the Fabians and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
Mr. Tremaine he began to have invitations, but
he declined them. Mr. Tremaine bought the
painting of the wave which he had seen at the
island, and one of his friends bought another of
Phil's marines.</p>

<p>The artist kept on with his work in the life
class at the Academy. Edgar sometimes tried
to get him for a festivity at the studio, but, as
he told his sister in disgust, one might as well
try to get the Shah of Persia.</p>

<p>Every Sunday evening Phil spent at the Fabians'
but never since he had returned to town
had he made opportunity to resume a disturbing
intimacy with Kathleen. Her book was
having a fairly good sale, and the girl was at
work upon another. Their lives lay apart mainly
except on the Sunday evenings when Mr. Fabian,
once again adjusted to his business life,
claimed the guest far more than any of the
others.</p>

<p>Edgar, finding that the propinquity of Phil
and Violet during his absence in the summer
had not produced any results, altered his expectations
of trouble from that quarter. He
made it a point to spend his Sunday evenings
with the family, in order, as his mother said,
to keep up the acquaintance; and on one of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
evenings, toward spring, he brought Violet
Manning to supper.</p>

<p>The busy young teacher's friendship with
Kathleen had not progressed. The latter firmly
believed that any romantic notions which such
a girl might conceive for Edgar would bring
her to grief in the end; and his present amazing
popularity but augmented that conviction; so
the girls had exchanged one call only during the
season.</p>

<p>Violet responded to Mrs. Fabian's invitation
for this Sunday and Edgar regarded her critically
throughout the evening.</p>

<p>Never had he felt himself such authority on
girls as now. They crowded his studio. Fashionable
girls, wealthy girls, pretty girls, plain girls,
clever ones, dull ones, aggressive, and shy girls;
and he had frequently detected himself comparing
the more interesting with Violet. Her
spirit, her poise, her independence, her compact,
graceful, healthy body, always stood the
test.</p>

<p>As of old, to-night she seemed more interested
in Phil than in himself. Her spontaneous joy
over the news that during the past week he had
sold a third picture, actually roused again Edgar's
old train of thought. How did he know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
what had occurred during the summer, between
the farmhouse and the Villa? Were these two
only waiting, perhaps, until Phil began to find
a sale for his pictures?</p>

<p>Poor little Violet was not intriguing. She
found herself embarrassed in Edgar's family
circle, and she was defending herself in the only
way she knew. It seemed as if it must be legible
on her face that she out-adored the adoration
of all the singer's pupils; and it was a relief to
her when she and the object were at last in a
taxicab on the way home. The cover of the
darkness, and the sober return to thoughts of
to-morrow's duties, made her heave an inaudible
sigh; but it is the unexpected that always
happens.</p>

<p>Edgar's teeth were tightly closed and every
street-lamp they passed showed him gazing at
his companion.</p>

<p>"I wonder," he said at last,&mdash;"I wonder,
Violet, why I've never been able to make you
like me better. Other&mdash;other people like
me."</p>

<p>"Probably that's the reason," returned the
girl lightly. "Some one must help strike an
average."</p>

<p>She did not say it easily; for she was obliged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
to swallow between sentences; but she said it
pretty well, and applauded herself.</p>

<p>"You see I love you, Violet," he went on, as
simply as the most non-temperamental swain
could have spoken.</p>

<p>She shrank into her corner, and when he tried
to take her hands she crossed them quickly
on her breast.</p>

<p>"Which mood is this?" she asked, a tumultuous
beating under the crossed hands.</p>

<p>"You don't believe me," said Edgar quietly.
"It's true, Violet. I want you to marry me.
You've made me believe once or twice&mdash;and
yet the next moment I always feel your utter
indifference. I'm afraid you're a flirt."</p>

<p>"I know you are!" responded the girl, her
fingers whitening against her fluttering heart.
"I'm afraid of you, Edgar."</p>

<p>Happiness leaped into his eyes and he gathered
her hands into his in spite of her.</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen 'The Concert'?" she
asked breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's what you mean!" exclaimed
Edgar triumphantly.</p>

<p>"You shouldn't marry," said Violet. "You
are like a matine idol. You will lose your capital
when you marry, unless you are like that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
selfish man. I warn you, I am not like that wonderful
wife. I couldn't bear it."</p>

<p>"You've thought about it, then," said Edgar
joyously.</p>

<p>"Yes, oh, yes," replied Violet, her defences
down and tears welling through her half-closed
lids. "I'm sure I should be miserable."</p>

<p>"Then you love me." Edgar drew her out of
her corner into his arms. "Violet, I promise
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dear," she interrupted him, "I am just as
much afraid of myself as of you. No convention
would hold me. The minute I found you were
not honest with me&mdash;that you concealed from
me&mdash;I should go. You would look about, and
I shouldn't be there."</p>

<p>Edgar held her close in ecstatic possession.</p>

<p>"And that's why I'll be honest with you,
Violet. I swear it. If we're both honest, what
can&mdash;"</p>

<p>The taxi-cab driver threw open the door.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Once again the daisy-snow drifted over the
hills on Brewster's Island; and Eliza sat in the
doorway of the Villa Chantecler watching Phil
adjust his possessions.</p>

<p>"When are the Fabians coming?" she asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span></p>

<p>"Next week."</p>

<p>"Are you and Miss Kathleen goin' to do
another book this year?"</p>

<p>"I hope so. She's going to let me see her
story when she comes. She has written her first
novel."</p>

<p>Eliza's eyes studied him sharply during a
silence.</p>

<p>"Is she engaged yet?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Not that I know of."</p>

<p>"I thought you two were pretty thick one
time there last summer."</p>

<p>"It's not for the likes o' me to be thick with
the likes o' her," replied Phil, busy setting up
an easel.</p>

<p>"I'd like to know why not," retorted Eliza,
who had read between the lines of Phil's letters
during the winter; and illustrated her imaginings
with looks and actions remembered from the
season before. "Think of the pictures you've
sold this winter. Look how quick you've begun
your success. Has Kathleen many beaux?"</p>

<p>"She has worshippers," returned Phil, with
a slight smile; "and several of them come
much nearer to her than I can."</p>

<p>"You can if you want to," said Eliza bluntly;
"you're a great fool if you don't."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span></p>

<p>Philip turned and looked at the speaker in
surprise. Her words were so exactly opposite
to the training he gave himself night and morning.</p>

<p>"'Tain't as if her father was so rich any
more. Nobody could say you was after money,
and," Eliza's voice lost its hardness, "your&mdash;your
Aunt Mary left me her ring you remember."</p>

<p>Phil smiled at her openly now, then he went
on with his work.</p>

<p>"You're a loyal soul, Eliza, and you always
yearn to give me everything I want; but Miss
Fabian will be married long before I'm able to
ask any woman to trust herself to me."</p>

<p>Eliza gave him a fierce nod and drew down
the corners of her mouth.</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;don't&mdash;believe it!</em>" she said, so significantly
that Phil flushed and looked at her
again.</p>

<p>"<em>I've</em> got eyes if you haven't," she added;
and with this Parthian shot she rose and went
back to the house.</p>

<p>Philip went on with his work, but the flush
stayed, and there was a line between his shining
eyes.</p>

<p>At this juncture Pat came up from the wharf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
with a heavy package. The family had returned
to the house in Gramercy Park, and he and
Phil had vacated the stable this spring.</p>

<p>"Sure the Queen o' Sheby hersilf stepped off
the boat," he announced as he came into the
Villa.</p>

<p>"My Aunt come!" exclaimed Phil, turning
around quickly. "I wonder what changed their
plan. Was she alone?"</p>

<p>"She was not, thin," declared the Irishman
proudly. "D'ye think the Princess didn't
come straight up and hold out her pretty hand
with a smile swate enough to beckon the bees?
'How d'ye do, Pat,' says she. ''Tis fine ye're to
be here this summer,' says she. 'We shall call
upon you for a lot o' help,' she says."</p>

<p>Philip stood still in indecision. No, he wouldn't
hurry over. They knew he was not expecting
the arrival; and he fell to business again.</p>

<p>The Irishman looked about him, on pictures
and sketches.</p>

<p>"Sure 'tis a power o' work ye've done, me
bye," he said. "I feel I shud have on a bathin'
suit to look at 'em."</p>

<p>Eliza from her window saw Captain James
drive up to the boulder cottage and saw the
ladies dismount, and with them the maid of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
all work with whom they intended this year to
live the simple life. Pat would be a valuable
auxiliary.</p>

<p>It was evening before Phil went across the
field to call. A brilliant planet showed a pale
wake of light across the water, forerunner of the
moon which was soon to rise.</p>

<p>"So serene, so soft, is she," thought Phil, in
whose head Eliza's words still rang, "and so
remote," he added. "So she shines on me, and
on all, alike. Eliza hasn't seen the others, so
she thinks me selected"; and he pressed down
the stopper which a long time ago he fitted to
repress disturbing emotions; for in the last hours
they had effervesced threateningly around its
rough edges.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian received him effusively and
Kathleen with the calm directness to which he
had adjusted himself.</p>

<p>"Your portrait comes off this summer, Aunt
Isabel," he said.</p>

<p>"I can't afford it, my dear," she answered.</p>

<p>Phil shook his head. "If I painted a portrait
of every Fabian on earth, would it pay my debt
to you?" he asked. "And anyway I have the
finest collection of Sidneys in the country; but
there isn't a portrait among them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do yourself sometime, Phil, will you?"
suggested Kathleen.</p>

<p>"Yes, and you," he replied. "I want to do a
picture of you on my terrace. Pat and I have
brought up the bay to-day; and I want to begin
it immediately."</p>

<p>"I know," laughed Kathleen. "You want to
do both mother and me before our complexions
desert us."</p>

<p>"I'll take you alternate days if you'll let me.
I'd like you to-morrow, for my background is
just as I want it." He turned to Mrs. Fabian.
"Will you lend me your daughter to-morrow?
I have the finest of Irish terriers for a watch-dog,
you know."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fabian shrugged her shoulders. "I certainly
shan't waste my time chaperoning you
two cousins at this late day," she answered.</p>

<p>On the afternoon following Eliza met Kathleen
coming across the field. She looked at her
in surprise, for instead of khaki the girl was
wearing a filmy white gown whose length was
lifted from the clover and buttercups, and carried
over her arm.</p>

<p>Eliza looked admiringly at the lithe figure,
and the deep eyes that beamed kindly upon her.</p>

<p>"No wonder you are startled, Eliza; I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
going to sit for my portrait," she said, clasping
Miss Brewster's hard hand.</p>

<p>"You look as if you was ready for your wedding,"
returned Eliza.</p>

<p>"I should like it to be here if I ever have one,"
said Kathleen; and Eliza watched the rose-color
spread from the girl's cheek to her brow, while
the young eyes kept their steady, kind regard;
then she inquired of Eliza as to the winter.</p>

<p>"I do believe she kind o' likes me for his
sake," thought Eliza, standing still to look
after the slender, graceful figure when Kathleen
moved on amid the daisies and clover.</p>

<p>"She's a flower herself. That's what she is,
and Mr. Philip didn't go as red as a beet for
nothin' when I spoke yesterday. He thinks
she's above him. There ain't anybody above
him!"</p>

<p>Whatever was the errand that had brought
Eliza into the field this afternoon she abandoned
it, and turned slowly back toward the farmhouse,
glancing often at the Villa through whose
door the slender white figure had disappeared.</p>

<p>"I wish there was somethin' I could do to help
'em," she thought. "That pretty critter can't
do a thing against Mr. Philip's determination
if he's set out. I know <em>him</em>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why was Kathleen so exquisite?" asked
Mrs. Wright as Eliza came in.</p>

<p>"Settin' for her portrait," answered Eliza
absently. "Said she was too dressed up to come
and see you, but would come to-morrow."</p>

<p>"She was a picture already, coming bareheaded
through that flowery field," said Mrs.
Wright.</p>

<p>Eliza did not respond. She disappeared into
her own room and closed the door. Then she
unlocked her trunk and took from its depths
a package which she untied, disclosing a fine
camel's-hair shawl. She unfolded it with loving
fingers, and regarded it. "A good enough weddin'
present even for her," she muttered.</p>

<p>Then she reached into another corner and
took out a tin box which she unlocked and drew
forth a tiny velvet case, rubbed and worn.
When she opened this, tears rushed to her eyes
and she lifted it to her lips. "Nothin' could
make you so happy, my dear one," she murmured
brokenly. "Nothin'! Nothin'!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Half an hour later Eliza entered the Villa.
Pat was doing some scraping of palette knives
in the kitchen. She looked timidly out on the
terrace. A lovely living picture met her eyes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
Kathleen was sitting on the white railing, her
filmy gown falling in folds at her feet. Behind
her rose the bay-crowned pillar casting shadows
on the red-glints of her hair.</p>

<p>"Mr. Philip, please excuse me," said Eliza
humbly; "but could you spare Pat to go on an
errand for us?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," replied Phil absently, working
at a white heat.</p>

<p>Eliza withdrew with quiet celerity. The errand
she required was to be performed at a distance,
and she was so nervous while she gave
Pat directions that he grinned at her.</p>

<p>"Ye're thinkin' about <em>thim</em>!" he said, jerking
his thumb over his shoulder in the direction of
the terrace.</p>

<p>Eliza's eyes widened. "Why in the world
should I think about them?" she asked, all the
time tolling Pat away toward the farmhouse.</p>

<p>"I cud look at 'em from now till Christmas
sittin' there," he responded. "I don't blame
ye."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"I haven't asked you about the turtle
doves," said Phil, sketching in Kathleen's
hands.</p>

<p>"They believe themselves the happiest people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
in the world, and perhaps they are. Violet has
really convinced me that she is the right girl for
Edgar. A meek one would have little chance."</p>

<p>"They're coming up here, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. Edgar can't get his vacation from
the church quite yet, and she'll not come till he
can."</p>

<p>"Of course not," replied Phil simply. "How
can one voluntarily live without the other a day
after the great discovery is made?"</p>

<p>Kathleen made no answer to this. The lump
that rose in her throat was rebellious; and the
artist, looking up suddenly, met fire in the
depths of her dark eyes. The lids dropped. His
hand grew suddenly unsteady.</p>

<p>"Tell me when you're tired, Kathleen," he
said. "We have the summer." He smiled as he
spoke; but it was a rigid sort of smile.</p>

<p>The field sown thickly with the late wild-flowers
of the island, and stretching to a sparkling
sea, the rustling orchard leaves, and the
crown of bay behind the queenly young head,
the soft white figure with the loosely dropped
hands! It was no time or place for Kathleen to
look at him like that.</p>

<p>"I'm tired now, I believe," she said, quietly.
"Will it be enough for to-day?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span></p>

<p>"At least until you're rested. Come in
and let me show you a sketch I did yesterday."</p>

<p>She rose and lifted her white shoulders with
a movement of weariness, then they moved inside
the room.</p>

<p>A vase of daisies stood on the table. "I believe,"
said Phil, "I should have asked you to
wear daisies in your hair."</p>

<p>They were standing by the table and he took
three of the long stems and breaking them to
convenient length made a movement toward
her head. Then he shrank. "Put them in, will
you?" he asked.</p>

<p>The least smile touched her lips, and her
hands hung down.</p>

<p>"You know best what you want," she replied
and inclined her regal head toward him.</p>

<p>The golden radiance streamed through the
small-paned windows and reddened her hair.</p>

<p>Phil's fingers trembled as they tucked the
flower stems under the soft folds. He dropped
his eyes from the lustrous tints, and they caught
a sudden elusive spark of violet, then green that
shone on the table. He looked closer, and
pointed.</p>

<p>"Did you leave your ring there?" he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span></p>

<p>Kathleen looked. A diamond ring was shining
beneath the tall candlestick.</p>

<p>She shook her daisy-crowned head.</p>

<p>"It's not mine," she said, wondering. "I
never saw it."</p>

<p>"Nor I." Phil's breath came faster. "This is
an enchanted place, Kathleen. The very spirit
of the sea must have pitied me in my struggle
and brought this ring." The ring! He looked
at it, dazed for another moment, then like a
flash he remembered Eliza's interruption, and
his illumined eyes met Kathleen's, grave and
wondering.</p>

<p>"I adore you, my darling. I give up the fight."
He kept his eyes on hers as he picked up the
quaint little jewel and pressed it to his lips.</p>

<p>Kathleen smiled at him, then her eyes veiled
and dropped.</p>

<p>He lifted her hand and slowly put the ring on
her finger; for the inner sanctuary of her heart
had flown open, and he had seen within.</p>

<p>Quickly he clasped her close in his arms. She
clung to him, and the golden radiance enveloped
them.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
